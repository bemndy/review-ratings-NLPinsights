I love this produce because the foaming dish soap is much easier to dispense just the right amount, and it's pre-foamed so it spreads on dishes more easily. This refill bottle is good for about three refills, so it is environment in that you're not throwing away the entire dispenser.

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,Downy Unstopables Fresh In-Wash Scent Booster Fabric Enhancer 26.5oz,US,Caused allergic reactions in our family,"This is really terrible stuff. The scent is extremely overpowering. And once it's in your clothes, you are committed to that fragrance for at least a month. At first, it smells like a strong after shave lotion, but then it starts to wear you down as it becomes sickeningly overbearing. But even worse, and far more important, there is something in this product that triggers an allergic reaction in quite a few people. My daughter used it on her clothes right before she came for a visit. She developed a rash everywhere the treated clothes toughed her body, and she sneezed and coughed until she was able to change into clothes that were not treated with Unstopable. We tried to wash out the scent, but even after repeated washings using unscented detergent in hot water, we could hardly make a dent in the power of this ""fragrance."" If you do a quick internet search, you'll find many had a problem with allergic reactions and with the product staining fabrics because it didn't completely dissolve.",1.0

I mistakenly used it for a second time and had to rewash a load of bed linens to get rid of that unbearable stench. I don't think I would have been able to sleep with that.

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,Ultra Downy Free & Gentle Liquid Fabric Softener – 129oz,US,Powerful Scent That Lasts,"As soon as I am in close proximity to my bottle of Downy Clean Breeze Liquid Fabric Enhancer, I pick up the scent. Not only does it's use keep my clothes smelling fresh for at least a week, the bottle sitting in my laundry room makes that room and my kitchen smell fresh as well. That said, the scent can be extremely overpowering if you use too much, so follow the measurements on the bottle. This scent is very reminiscent of Downy's original scent.Does it soften my clothes? Absolutely! What I really like is that it helps my clothes maintain shape, especially around the necklines of my tops. It seems to tighten the weaves of the fabrics.I have an older washing machine which requires me to add Downy at the rinse, no automated dispenser. Sometimes I forget, which can be frustrating. Dryer sheets are preferable because of this reason, but are not as effective as Downy liquid.I have read many articles that say fabric softeners can reduce the flame retardancy of clothing. For that reason alone I would typically want to only use this for bath towels. However, this is a fabric conditioner. I don't know if the formulation is the same as the Downy fabric softener. I think the whole point is that Downy products are wonderful for softening and conditioning clothing, doing exactly what it says it will do. The safety aspects concern me, and I see nothing on the label telling the consumer not to be concerned.Overall, this is a product that does what it should and smells great doing so.

The dry cloths can be a bit pricy, but we buy those in bulk from Sam's. We use it to sweep our hardwood floors and then use a handheld vac to suck up the dirt and clean off the dry cloths to reuse them multiple times. The wet cloths work alright, but will only clean a small area, unless you use another spray & mop product. If you want a wet mop, we love the Swiffer Wet Jet, it's a much better solution for mopping a whole room or the whole house. I'd highly recommend the Swiffer Sweeper, it's cheap, but very sturdy, easy to use, and doesn't take up much room.

The floors dry quickly after using these. They have a scrubbing edge that is kind of difficult to use, but when I really need it, I manage. I honestly could live without that, though. I have been able to get double usage from these by flipping them over when one side gets dirty. I used to buy these in a large box, but I found that I use them so infrequently that the lower pads dried out, so now I buy the smaller packages, in multi-packs, so they don't dry out in between uses. I wish they'd make a natural version of these with a vinegar base. I'd be all over that.",4.0

I found you can flip these over and use the reverse side when the other side is dirty. These perform well. Swiffer gets the job done. I am very happy with the refills.

Even if I cook fish I try to air out the house afterward because I don't like the smell. It's hard for me to find air freshener that I actually like. They either don't work, don't last, or the scent triggers a migraine. This product is the only one I'll use. We have three dogs and three cats. Even though the house is definitely big enough to accommodate them all and the cat's litter boxes are changed every day and the cat litter works great, in the rooms that have litter boxes there is always a bit of a litter smell and I hate it. Then there are the dogs. They are bathed regularly so the dogs don't really stink in and of themselves but my Shar Pei and my Amstaff both fart like it's a sport. Thankfully the chihuahua doesn't (or he's just too small for us to notice). Seriously it is horrible and at times it has been so bad it has brought me close to vommiting. The Amstaff is always by us and will lay down by the couch during family movie time and it never fails. He will fart and look up and around and at us like maybe we are the ones who caused noxious odor that suddenly appeared and he will get up and leave the room. Yep. That's right. His farts are so bad he has to leave the room after he passes gas. This is the ONLY spray that has ever gotten rid of that horrid smell right away. It's the only one that leaves the litter areas smelling fresh for long periods of time. And since it can handle the dog farts it can pretty much handle any odor our household tends to throw at it quickly and efficiently and it hasn't ever triggered one of my migraines (which some scents do). Definitely recommend if you're looking for a powerful and efficient air freshener.",5.0

I had 8 siblings growing up, add 2 parents, and Grandma. That made a lot of dishes for 3 meals a day. We were quickly assigned to load the dishwasher, add the Cascade, and start the dishwasher. It ran after 3 meals a day. The green boxed Cascade has always been under the kitchen sink, and ready to use in the dishwasher for as long as I can remember. It was there when I was a young girl and it continues to be a tradition in my home some 35 years later. Cascade always made the dishes clean and sparkling, even the glasses. There were no water spots or dirty forks after going through the Cascade wash in the dishwasher. This product has been around for years and years. Certainly the liquid and the gel packs have been added to the line-up of wonderful Cascade products. Cascade has always been a winner in my family!

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,TIDE LQ2X HE WTD AF 4/92Z 59LD,US,Strong stuff...gets stains out,"Tide is excellent and even gets out lipstick when other things won't, so I generally save my bottle of Tide for the hard-to-wash stuff and use my lown-line, almost as good detergent for everything else. I don't think it can be beat, but you have to be careful...it can bleed colors. It ruined a dark-green cotton suit that got the liquid on it directly...not a good thing. So perhaps do what I do...save it for the heavy stuff....or be cautious with the application of the liquid.",5.0

I got home from the gym and was excited to use this stuff and see if it really would help neutralize the odor on my following gym session. I did my laundry and poured in a top full of it and of course I loved the scent! When my laundry was done and I opened the washer to bring out the clothes and load the dryer I was thrown back at how clean everything smelled! (Then again downy always does that) I loaded the dryer and when it was done and I opened the door I was received by another whiff of the April fresh scent. I looove that scent and nothing says clean like it. I then folded and put away. That experience was great but nothing compared to what happened next! The following day I went to the gym and obviously sweated during my session but I was pleasantly surprised with how light yet strong the scent was still there with me! It’s a calming scent and it’s definitely not overpowering but it’s sooo nice to not smell the stereotypical “gym scent” after such a good session! Suffice to say I didn’t even feel the need to use any body spray after! It definitely deodorizes and neutralizes scent! I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5.0

See photo.,"Despite other positive reviews - my experience unfortunately mirrors the top 1-star review - and then some. This detergent: 1. Makes hands sticky - coating them in a film that requires you to wash your hands, afterward. The outer coating of the capsules appears to not be stable. This is at room temperate (70 degrees F) and low humidity. 2. Capsules leave behind a thick paste (See big glob at bottom of photo that was left behind on the interior of my washer and some on my clothes) It could not even be removed with just water and a wash cloth - but needed soap itself to be cleansed - the irony! 3. Item is not eligible for returns on Amazon (although the CSR from Amazon kindly offered a refund) Since the above occur under normal operating conditions and that Tide claims that the ""Tide PODS laundry pacs dissolve quickly in hot & cold,"" there was no prior warning or user error.

Home Care,Mr Clean,SURFACE CARE,"Mr. Clean Magic Eraser Bath Scrubber, 4-Count (Pack of 2)",US,This is how you clean a bathtub,"I've used these a couple of times now and I'm really impressed with how much easier it makes cleaning, and how much cleaner it makes my bath. I play beach volleyball a lot in the warm season so my tub gets dirty quickly. Even spots that look clean, when I run one of these pads over them, I can feel the resistance as the pad bites into the grime. After a few swipes, that resistance is gone. Actually, with these, I get my tub so squeaky clean that it's a little bit uncomfortable to bathe in it for a couple of days because of the squeakiness! Of course, when I consider that it's only squeaky because the tub is so utterly clean, I can hardly complain. The first time I cleaned with these, I also went after the grout between the tiles, which had gotten pretty pinkish-yellow. I got that to maybe half as bad as it had been before, but my arm got tired, but when I woke up the next day, I swear it was only a quarter as bad as it had been to begin with. So it seems that the magic continues to happen even after you stop scrubbing. Grout remains a pain in the butt, but I was surprised these did as well as they did there. I used to just clean my bathroom with a sponge and some Pine-Sol or something, because that's how you clean anything, right? Well that's not how you clean a bathtub. This is how you clean a bathtub.",5.0

I ordered this orange cleaner by mistake probably because it was so much cheaper in price.

Today has been a deep cleaning sort of day. I had no trouble putting together the wand. The instructors were very clear and it was rather self-explanatory. However, I did have trouble with the wet pads. When I first opened the sample pad, the cleaning solution leaked everywhere. By everywhere I mean my island, down the cabinet and on the floor. A quick wipe down took care of the mess. Then I pressed the pads into the slots and started on the puddles created from the extra solution. I immediately noticed the dirt collected on the clothes. With in a couple of minutes of using the sweeper, the pad came off. I discarded it and put on a new one. This time I was careful about where I opened it. As with the first pad, it had a lot of extra liquid. I had it contained this time. So, I started back on my floor. Almost immediately, this pad came off the sweeper, too. I pushed it on and continued. It came off. I put it back on and then it started to come off again. I took a photo of it. Although this does a nice job of cleaning, it takes some practice to get the pads secure enough to stay put. Hopefully I have better luck with just the dry pads. If that's the case, I'll buy dry refills and then use a spray cleaner on my floor, in place of the wet pads. I'm still hopeful for this product and I have already tossed out another product I was formerly using. I plan to use this again as I continue to prepare for my holiday guests.

For bathroom odors, it has worked very well.It neutralizes the odors instead of layering on top of the odors like Lysol Lavender bathroom spray. For the carpet and the mattress, it has been less effective. I don't want to saturate the material to get it to smell better. I prefer the bamboo scent. I'm not overly sensitive to smells, so someone with a more sensitive olfactory system may find this overpowering as other users have mentioned, but no one in our house has found the scent to be overwhelming.

I was afraid to try them but I didn't have any issues at all and my clothes were and smelled clean and no dumping into the detergent bin. Then I noticed almost all of those reviews said ""it didn't break up in the detergent dispenser"" or ""got stuck inside the detergent dispenser"" These pods do NOT go in the detergent dispenser. You add the pods IN WITH THE CLOTHING. Right into the drum not in the dispenser. This is why a lot of people are having problems. I threw some laundry in the drum, added the pod, and added more laundry. Not saying it's eveybody. A few did add to the drum and still had issues but it's the majority. As for buying them again on the bottle it says ""add two for L load and 3 for XL"". Well, that's gonna get expensive real fast.

Sure enough, when I read the ingredients, that's what you see. Just because it smells good doesn't mean it cleans well and how strong is the scent AFTER the wash? Well, it cleaned amazing and the scent lasted through the dryer (house smells so good). I have a messy dog, kids (including a newborn), a messy husband (his job) and I cook and clean (not to mention my messy job as well). So my laundry runs on heavy/soiled for the most part.

Home Care,Febreze,AIR CARE,Febreze NOTICEables Dual Scented Oil Warmer  Kit (Pack of 3),US,"Worked great on high, ""low"" setting did not work","This is for the hardware only, not any of the scented oils. I am using this in a townhouse, next to 2 cat litter boxes that have hoods/covers on them. We have 2 cats and I clean the boxes daily of course. This is not unlike having a diaper-pail, and an air freshener is unavoidable. My warmer unit has 2 settings, low and high. And off apparently. There must be varying degrees of HEAT associated with EACH warmer-machine. In other words they must perform a little differently for such a low price-point. For my unit, the LOW setting had no effect that I could tell, after 24 hours of being plugged in, in our townhouse entry hallway. There is no way that anyone would be driven out of their house by this, to say the least. On high setting, it performed a little stronger than I would have liked, but it filled the 20-foot long hallway nicely, and the smell comes up the open stairwell a little too, so that you smell it as you take your first step down a traditional square-circular townhouse stairwell. Based on other reviews, I am hoping to get 14 days out of this on high-setting. I may go back to the competition which has a DIAL for heat-settings, start it off on low, and turn it up a bit every 4 days or so. When the liquid is NEW, it absolutely does its job on high-setting, but some might find certain scents to be too strong, and replacement oils on high-setting, will be needed much faster of course. I might look into those videos that show you how to refill the things.",4.0

Now that our older kids are getting to where they can do their own laundry I've made sure to have the pods detergent on hand after I found a washer full of suds more than once after they filled the liquid measuring cup to the brim for small loads. The one thing I was worried about with these was that they wouldn't dissolve completely and I'd be left with bits to clean out of the machine. Even with our low water he machine it hasn't been a problem at all. I do keep liquid detergent on hand for tiny loads with just a couple items but otherwise we use the pods, they see, to clean well even when I pack the washer full.

I hate buying these because I'm always suspicious of claims that one product is spectacular in comparison to any other product in its category but I ended up having to buy this platinum stuff when I ran out of the normal stuff. I only use this when I need a heavy scrub now and I put in one normal one and then this platinum one goes in the holder that pops open during the wash. Pretty amazing. I replaced a really high end dishwasher with a basic, cheap one this year because I wanted actual handles and buttons instead of a computerized control board. I have to say, when I use this stuff, my cheap dishwasher works just as well as my very expensive one did...and I don't have to worry about fried computer boards.

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,Downy Ultra Free & Gentle Fabric Conditioner 77 fl. oz. Jug,US,Pure and Clean,I traditionally like a bit of scent but my fiancé has sensitive skin so I was pleased to try downy free and gentle fabric softener. It is as easy to use as any liquid fabric softener. It is fragrance and dye free which is great for ultra sensitive skin. I've used it on many loads now and my fiancé has seen no irritation from it at all. It leaves clothes relatively soft and so far maintained color and shape of the clothes. It also doesn't leave a residue like some softener can do and it reduces static. It's an all around win if you have someone in your household who has sensitive skin.,4.0

I find just running it over these surfaces about once a week until ""smooth"" feeling pretty much keeps the soap scum from being there - glass is clear etc. Very quick to do, no bad chemicals, and the eraser lasts a very long time so I'm confident cost is minimal. Also good on painted walls (kids fingerprints etc) and removed quite the buildup of dog nose prints on the glass door to back yard...

True to form, we were down to wire trying to prep all the food and get the house ready for company. When we are cleaning, our floors usually get the shaft. We typically do a quick once over with the vacuum, but that is the extent of it. As the minutes ticked by, closer and closer to the arrival of our families, we were panicked just trying to get everything cleaned. That is when the heavens opened up and the angels began to sing. In a matter of minutes the entire floor was free of debris, clean as a whistle, and smelling fresh. I was in disbelief of how easy and fast it was while still doing an incredible job getting our tile clean. Kitchen, foyer, and bathrooms done in the blink of an eye. I was as excited as a kid at Christmas. Funniest part is, my husband once tried to buy it when we moved into our house, and I shot it down every time. I didn't think the money would be worth, and I was hanging on to the delusion that the old mop was just as good. Boy was I wrong! Lesson learned--new technologies can be pretty amazing.

I bought these Tide Odor Rescue pods thinking it would be my solution but these made the smell so much more terrible!! It doesn't even get rid of the odor, it just masks it with a super strong chemical smell. I am sensitive to fragrances and the smell that lingered on my clothes gave me a full blown migraine. I got such terrible allergies and a headache from this that lasted 5 days. I ended up going to the Urgent Care clinic and they told me my symptoms were severe allergies. This product gave me such bad allergies that I got a migraine and felt dizzy and congested. It was TERRIBLE! If you are sensitive to fragrances, DO NOT buy this! I rewashed my clothes again without the Rescue pods and I can't get rid of the horrible smell! That's how strong the smell is. I actually prefer the stinky underarm smell to the chemical smell of these pods.

Sorry, it's going to be an embarrassing evening. Going back to Quantum which clean as much (better) and are 100% reliable. Why? This is because the outer coating is transparent and water dissolving.

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer Disposable Cleaning Dusters Refills, Unscented, 16-Count (Packaging May Vary)",US,"Traps dirt, expensive, doesn't last, disposable.","The swifter duster is a great idea and a nice, cheap dusting tool. Pros: It collects and hugs the dirt, so you remove dust instead of just moving it around. Cons: It fills up quickly. I dust my house three times per week and it still fills up after just a couple of rooms. So the price per unit isn't super expensive, but the quantity makes them expensive! These dusters are disposable, so they add to the landfills. These dusters are not decomposable, so the aliens will find them thousands of years after we've become extinct. The dusters become tangled after just 1-3 rooms and stop working. The dusters cannot be washed. Overall, they are good to teach kids how to dust or in a pinch, but I wouldn't use them regularly because of both the expense and waste.  I was not compensated in any way for my review of this product. I am trying to get my reviewed rating up, so if you found this review helpful, please indicate so.

Jug,US,"\""Down\""right Fantastic!","I have never used a liquid fabric softener in my life, so I honestly didn't know what to expect. I read the instructions on the bottle and on my washing machine to make sure I was doing everything correctly. Because I have a pretty basic washing machine, it doesn't have a liquid fabric softener dispenser so I had to make sure I manually added it in at the right time. I'm not going to lie; that part is kind of a pain because I kept forgetting. Hence, the reason my review is so late! At any rate, I do have to say I am pleased with the overall results. It did seem that my clothes were a bit softer and they didn't seem to be as wrinkled as they usually are when I forget to take them right out of the dryer. I definitely will keep using it, but I just need to remember to add it at the proper time in my wash cycle.",4.0

This is especially true in the makers of Gain Laundry supplies. I have autoimmune disease that causes my senses to be very sensitive when it comes to the items that I purchase to use in my home. I now buy all of my laundry products, cleaning supplies including air freshener and the like in the original scent of Gain. I found that the smell is one that I can tolerate and with it just being the same scent all over my home, I don't have a strong reaction any longer. Gain has always been a very good product as far as performance in clothes laundering and for the last nine years, it has kept my clothes and bedding smell fresh and clean even though I am incontinent.

Home Care,Cascade,Auto Dishwashing,"Cascade Platinum Actionpacs Dishwasher Detergent, Fresh Scent, 62 Count",US,Best Dishwasher Pacs available and the only one's I'll use anymore.,"Cascade Platinum ActionPacs are my go to for my dishwasher. Even if I have days old crusties on my dishes, it only takes one of the platinum ActionPacs to clean everything. I used to use lower cost dishwasher pods but it took 2 or 3 to get them as clean as these Platinum ones. So overall, the net cost is lower for me to just suck it up and buy these more expensive pods that work WAY better. Even with my 25 year old dish washer. Pro tip: Run your kitchen faucet on hot until it the water coming out of the tap is hot. It saves money because your dishwasher doesn't have to heat up the incoming water nearly as much, and it starts of the cleaning cycle with hot water which gives a better chance of everything coming out sparkling clean. Also, shop on a amazon over a few days, since the prices fluctuate slightly from day to day. Occasionally they also offer a coupon which lowers the cost per load significantly.",5.0

I worry about shrinkage or ruining the fabric. So softness is sometimes lost. Not after using this Downy Fabric Conditioner. My clothes are super soft after hanging them dry. Less wrinkles too! The clothes look just like they were brand new. One shirt in particular just looks so much brighter and new, and I’ve had it for years. The smell is so fresh without being over powering.

Makes sense to go for the largest size for the cheapest price right? I usually never look at the directions since it seems like you always have to pour a little extra to get things clean even with High-efficiency detergents. CAUTION! If you don't have the money or room to have a state of the art Wi-Fi washing machine where it can send notifications to your cell phone to shut it down. Just pour in a TINY amount especially if you live in a city where living space is very limiting (and so is your washer) or you will have so much suds coming out that it will set off your motion detector! Case in point this is strong stuff and will last FOREVER! I use a tablespoonful(15ml)( half a shot glass) for those drinkers out there, for my small washer.

Especially good at cleaning plastic and nastier non-water soluble gunky marks. I'll often use a terry or microfiber cloth for the first pass, then the magic eraser to get the rest. That way the magic eraser lasts longer - eventually they get compacted and/or break apart. Sure makes cleaning much easier than when I was a kid!",5.0

My goodness, this thing erased every little scuff mark, dirt stain, grass stain, mud... everything! It worked wonders on my white converses, and left them looking bright and white again, instead of that gross grey-yellow it was before. I do have to warn you though, this magic eraser can erase dyes from shoes and clothing, so make sure the eraser and water dripping from the eraser doesn't get onto any areas you don't want to clean. There's a slight whitish stain from this eraser on my turquoise converses because I accidentally dripped some residue on there. Oh well. At least the soles are bright and shiny! The eraser does disintegrate after use, especially after rubbing on rough surfaces. On glass and smooth walls, the eraser holds up fairly well before breakage.

Minus two for coming off of the handle way too easily. The handle is easy to put together and operate. (what I mean is that it's easy to change the angle and length, while having it stay that way on its own without having to force or fight with it.) The fluffy duster part is quite small and comes off of the handle too easily since there is no friction or attachment to keep it from doing so. I had to place it back on several times while dusting dvd/Blu ray cases and the shelves. I think I will only use this to dust high areas that I cannot reach well on my own (I'm 5'4 so there's a lot of shelves I have a hard time reaching.) such as high bookshelves and the top of the ceiling fan blades.

The soft pack has many different great functions. It has a self-sealing opening/lid that greatly reduces spills and leaks. Also with this self-sealing opening you have a lot more control of the amount of soap you dispense, that's because there's no hole for the soap to seep out of and you control how much comes out by how hard you squeeze the pouch. The pouch has a visually appealing design and isn't an eye sore, it also stands up straight and doesn't fall over, which I initially thought it might since it's a soft pack. The soap itself is the regular great quality dawn soap, it removes grease and leaves dishes looking crystal clear and extremely clean. Overall, I prefer the soft pack to the plastic bottle. It's a wonderful product at a wonderful price! Hope this helps!",5.0

Home Care,Swiffer,SURFACE CARE,Swiffer Wetjet Pads With The Power Of Mr. Clean Magic Eraser 20 Count,US,okay,These are just okay. They do provide for a quick and convenient cleanup but are not a substitute for a deep cleaning.

So I tend to mop towards one edge where I can use a towel to wipe up the line of dust it pushes there.,3.0
Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,"Tide Washing Machine Cleaner, 5 Count",US,Good tips for cleaning and maintaining your washer,"The product appears to work great but I can't give it all 5 stars because of the fragrance that's added. It would be a fantastic product if not for the fragrance smell that lingers. That being said I wanted to share some knowledge that I learned after having my Bosch front load washer serviced. The black build up is actually soap residue and NOT mold or mildew. The musty smell isn't mildew, it's the soap residue breaking down. We switched over to liquid detergent and that's when our troubles began. First of all, liquid detergents are much more concentrated than they use to be. DO NOT follow the package directions, use less than half of what the detergent recommends. Gauge how your clothes are cleaned after a cycle and adjust your soap level from there. Less is more in this case. Secondly, do not run a clean cycle with soap. My Bosch instructions said to run a hot cotton cycle with soap if there was a smell. This unfortunately made the issue worse. Just run a sanitation cycle with no soap each month. If you see the water suds during a sanitation or rinse cycle then that means you have residual soap in your machine and you need to either use cleaner to get rid of it. Thirdly, be sure to drain the water from your machine each month if that's an option for you. The soap build up will be there too and this will contribute to any smells. Also, let your machine air out after each washing, this will help prevent any issues mold or mildew issues. We open the draw and keep the washer door open for at least a day after we've done laundry and then (because it's in a hallway) we only partially close them just so we can close the closet door. The service technician also recommended using Lysol wipes on the rubber gasket. We just had ours replaced because the soap build up was attacking the rubber. I haven't used the Lysol wipes yet, I've just been using a paper towel to dry the rubber gasket for now when I've finished laundry for the day. The current washing machines definitely waste less water and are more efficient cleaner clothes but they do require more maintenance than the washing machines of old. By just making these few changes, the washing machine should provide less headaches and last a lot longer. The technician did say that if there is a lot of black, residual soap build up that vinegar isn't strong enough to get rid of it. So, I'm hoping that I can get by with only using the washing machine cleaner when needed rather than each month just because the fragrance is so strong. I might even try only using half of it. Don't really understand why they needed to add the fragrance to it.",4.0

The so-called softener sheets just don't get it when it comes to that April fresh smell. Even good old Downy liquid seems to have lost it's punch, at least now we have a front loader. These things however are great! You put them right into the washer and they take out even the mustiest of odors not to mention making everything smell great! We had an old comforter we were about to give up on because it always had a slight musty odor no matter how we washed it. This product handled even that! As a bonus, they also work well if you have a spot around that house that may have odor problems. I've sprinkled a few by hand in the bottom of trash cans that smelled bad before replacing the trash bag and even in the bottom of the clothes hamper in the Kids bathroom. Works like a champ as they also take care of those odors. Picked up a Dash button for this stuff because we never plan to stop using it",5.0

Home Care,Mr Clean,SURFACE CARE,"Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, Original, 4 Count",US,Perfect for cleaning....everything,"Is there anything these magic erasers don't clean? from walls, to my glass top stove, these magic erasers have replaced nearly every other cleaning tool in my house. They even get (non-washable) crayon and pen of my wall paint with ease. EASE, I tell you. I don't understand how they work so well and make cleaning things so easy, but I am so thankful. I ran out in the middle of wiping down my doors and switched to a wet rag and I couldn't believe how much more elbow grease I had to use with the wet rag to get the same amount of clean. My only complaint is that they seem to ""dissolve"" very quickly so I have to keep a pretty large stash around if I'm going to use them all other the house, but seriously it's worth it. ""Eraser"" is a good word for them since they do dissolve with use, think like an old-fashioned pencil eraser, and sometimes there's a whitish residue left behind that I feel like I want to wipe off (depending on how much water I used in the sponge and what I'm washing). Funny story, I used chalk paint and furniture wax to paint a small chair. The next weekend my toddler colored all over it with a crayon (I hate crayons), and her big sister tried to use a magic eraser to get it off before I saw it, well the eraser worked so good it took the wax and paint right off the chair! that's some serious scrubbing ability.",5.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer Sweeper Dry Sweeping Cloths Mop And Broom Floor Cleaner Refills Febreze Lavender Vanilla & Comfort Scent , 48 Count",US,"Good clean and good smell, but don't cover a large area","My wife and I have used other Swiffer products and we were both excited to give the Swiffer Sweeper Wet Pads a try in our home. The mop handle that was included with the refill pads was easy to put together before the first use. The pads are also easy to install by simply unfolding the edges and wrapping the pad around the mop surface. My pads did come undone, so I had to find a way to get them to stick better, pushing as much of the pad into the holders as possible. Once attached well, they did not come out. We do not have a large area of hardwood floors to clean with the wet pads so the cleaning did not take very long - maybe 10 minutes. That being said, I did have to use two pads to cover the whole area since the first pad dried out about half-way through. I wish they lasted longer and covered more area. The wet pads do a good job of cleaning the area they do cover. I did not have to go back over spots very often. Most of the time it was to spread out the solution to a larger area. I did not pre-sweep the area before using the wet pads and would recommend doing so. The pads do a good job of picking up dust, but as good with other larger debris that ends up on the floors. I also noticed it removed water spots and left a nice clean finish on the floors. The lavender and vanilla scent is nice and refreshing. It is not too overpowering and gives the house a cleaner feel. It's nice to not only see that the floor is clean but also have it smell clean at the same time. Overall, I like this product and think it does a good job of cleaning our hardwood and laminate floors. The pads do not cover as large of an area as I would like, but do a good job cleaning the area they do cover. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4.0

Fabric Care,Gain,Laundry,GAIN FLINGS ORIG 4/81 CT  E,US,"Clean great, smell great, super convenient",Ive been using these pods about a year now and they work great for me. Ive never had a problem with them not dissolving or sticking to my clothes. I have a top loading machine and use either 1 or 2 pods depending on the size of the load. I put the pods in the machine during the fill cycle and allow the water to fill a bit before putting in the clothes. I think the trick to using these pods is to put them in the machine and let them get wet and slippery before putting in your clothes. I believe the people who are having trouble with the pods not dissolving are using the new front loading machines designed to use as little water as possible to wash your clothes. Of course the pods wont dissolve if there isnt enough water. With that said they work great with a top loading machine and I will stick with this brand.,5.0

I've used the previous pods from Tide but never the ones with Downy in them. In terms of cleaning and protection, they seem identical. My clothes come out feeling fresh and clean. There's never a time that I have to wash clothes over again to remove stains with these pods. The main difference I've notice from the other pods is the smell/feeling of the clothes. The Downy acts like a fabric softener and makes the clothes feel and smell great. There's no need for mixing or adding any other liquids. Five stars for this as it's an all-in-one solution for clean clothes that smell great - and all it requires is a pod; no additional liquids or solutions. Definitely make the switch if you haven't already.",5.0

I do have a front loader so I am cognizant that you have to get clothes out fast or everything will start to smell. When I first pulled my first load it using this product it reeked. I thought I waited too long (an hour?). I ran it again and added Borax and hung it up to dry (as I always do). Walked past my line and it reeked ever so slightly. Ran another load and immediately hung it up. It smelled. I started investigating if something went seriously wrong with my washer or there was a leak in my house! The smell was that pungent. I ran my next load for other reasons with an arm and hammer detergent...lo and behold normal smell. May I add I had to wipe loads of gooey gunk off the seal of my washer after those first two loads. Not a coincidence now that it's all coming together. Guess I'll use the rest of the bottle on maybe dish rags as it does not ""upset"" my washer as far as suds go. Maybe I just am uber picky about smells and didn't realize it-but it smells like mildew or wet dog. 3 stars because the clothes looked really clean.

Home Care,Cascade,Auto Dishwashing,"Cascade Platinum Actionpacs Dishwasher Detergent, Fresh Scent, 62 Count",US,Powder performs much better -- and is much cheaper,"I decided to do some tests at home with Cascade powder, gel, and action packs. I did several rounds of tests with dried on foods and pots and pans. I found that the gel did worst, usually only cleaning maybe 90 percent of the food. The pods did second best, but it still couldn't get all the dried on foods. The powder did the best by far -- no matter what I did it was able to get everything off. The powder was amazing, and it's so much cheaper than these pods. I was truly impressed with the powder. I read in consumer reports that the pods do outperform the gels, since the gels don't contain the chemicals necessary for dissolving both proteins and grease. However, the powder does contain both ingredients. My findings seem to be in line with what Consumer Reports found. I really suspect that these pods are a scheme for the detergent corporations to charge more for detergent and increase profit. I highly suggest using the powder instead -- it's really amazing stuff.",1.0

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,Tide PODS Ocean Mist HE Turbo Laundry Detergent Pacs 72-load Tub,US,The only thing I will use,"I have some problems that make Tide Pods so important in my life. I am disabled and live in an apartment. Therefore, I have to walk to the laundry with my laundry. I'm able to take just as many pods as I need and put them in my laundry basket. I do have a wagon when I have too many loads but it's still hard to make room for detergent and fabric softener bottles in the wagon, including the weight of them for the disabled. This helps so much! Another issue I have is my wonderful fur baby, who is neutered, that still insists on spraying in the apartment even though he's fully housebroken. I have managed to get him to only spray on towels if I put a couple down on the laminate floor. So, I guess he is housebroken and towel broken. This makes it very important to have a detergent that works very well since I am constantly washing towels that have large German Shepherd size amounts of pee on them. I could not be more happy with Tide detergent for how clean it makes my laundry and the pods for the convenience with my disability! Thank you Tide! Please don't stop making pods to continue helping people in situations like mine. I am sorry to hear that a few people are getting stains and having plastic stick to their clothing. I use Ocean Mist pods for HE even though the washers I use are top loaders. Maybe that could help with anyone having problems. I wonder if it might be the type of washers instead of the pods since it doesn't seem to be the norm. I have not experienced anything like that and pray I don't.",5.0

I purchased one the first time I saw it come out years ago, not sure how long ago it was but it had to be over 8 years ago. It lasted a few years. I actually wrote the company and purchased extra filters over that time period because the battery outlasted the filters. I remember it was only $20! I have purchased at least 6 over years as gifts. But with each purchase the price went up, which didn't bother me because they work ""so well"". They are now any where from $45 to $65 each! With advances in technology, I thought the price should go down, not up! In the past year, I have purchased 2 for my personal use. The first couple uses they actually got through three rooms. Luckily, I only use it in three rooms. But now, the use time is abysmal. I can't even get through one room! I LOVE the way it works, I HATE the price and the battery life. I am inspired to invent my own vac that uses swiffer cloths. SUCKS the way things are manufactured now a days, make it fast, cheap...and don't let it last too long!

Eliminate Them with the Tide + Downy Odor Defense Collection Designed for Regular and HE Washing Machines (front- and top-loaders) (I have a HE front loader -- just throw it into the tub before adding laundry) Tide PODS laundry pacs dissolve in hot and cold water I've had the Tide Pods for a week or so now -- I do laundry everyday -- my husband and son work outside (my son is also a runner), so I've used these Pods for every laundry situation imaginable -- heavily soiled work clothes, running clothes, dishtowels, bath towels, bed sheets, delicates....and they have performed as promised. The directions do say to put a couple of pods in for a large load -- I didn't notice that and just threw in one for my large loads and they came out fine. Would I recommend this product -- yes, I would, especially for heavily soiled laundry.",5.0

I have a personal preference that i love a very strong scent and this does not have as much scent as I like. I would only purchase it if it were on sale or i had a coupon. Nothing special to me.

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,Downy Lq 77Oz/90Ld Free,US,Sensitive Children,"As someone that has children that are sensitive to certain smells and perfumes I thought Ultra Downy Free & Gentle would be a great product to try. While there is a slight scent to this product, its nothing that will jump out at you; one would have to smell very close to smell it, which smells clean. Once I added Free & Gentle to the water, I was a little concerned as the water looked milky and did not produce any type of bubbles. However, I must say that after the cycle completed the clothes had no scent except a clean, crisp one. Reminded me of when my mother would hang my clothes on the line in the sun. While I personally like a product that has a strong smell to it, and for that purpose won’t be using this product for my clothes; I will be using it for my children as it works perfect for them.

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,"Tide Pods He Turbo Laundry Detergent Packs, Spring Meadow, 81 Count",US,Seemed To Solve My Stale Laundry Smell Problem,"I purchased this tub of Tide pods a while back and had them in my pantry. Right after buying it I went on a ""back to natural"" kick. I started using Method and Seventh Generation laundry detergents. I'm NOT saying these detergents caused the problem that followed but I'm just noting what I was using. All of a sudden all my laundry started having an unpleasant smell....actually I consider it a nasty smell. I washed once, rinsed twice using vinegar and a softener by the same maker but nothing helped. If the laundry didn't smell funky when it came out of the dryer, it did within a few days. I was at my wits end for months trying to figure out what was causing the smell. I ran my washer without clothes in it with vinegar. My dryer was fine and very clean. I regularly cleaned my washing machine. What the heck. Then I got so frustrated I ran my washing machine through an entire wash and rinse cycle using a full cup of citric acid and dug out the Tide pods. I throw 2 pods in my standard top loading large capacity washing machine as it's filling with warm water. I let the water agitate a minute or so until the pods dissolve and then throw in my laundry. My machine has one ridiculously short rinse cycle so I let the machine go through both cycles to wash. I figure the short rinse gets some of the soap out. I'm a stickly for no soap residue in my clothes. I run the wash cycle again as a full rinse using 1/2 to 1 cup of vinegar and a capful of the above mentioned softener. I didn't buy a different softener brand as of yet. All I can say is my clothes are now very clean and smell great. I noticed there is a small percentage of negative comments here mostly referring to the pods staining their clothes. Regardless of what anyone tells you, I STRONGLY suggest you put the pods in your washing machine while it's filling with water and let it run a minute or so to dissolve the pods BEFORE adding your clothes. To me, it makes sense that it would eliminate the issue of pods sticking to/or staining clothes. Don't pour softener directly onto clothes either. That can also stain your clothes.",5.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer Sweeper Wet Refill with Febreze, Lavender/Vanilla, 36 Count",US,"I love these things - perfect for in-between deep cleans for kitchen tile, and CAN be cost effective if you buy/use them right","I just love these. I always have a carton or 3 around and use them in between my ""deep cleaning"" (mopping or steam cleaning) days. They leave a great fresh smell that makes a big part of the house smell great. I usually use these things on a Mint (I guess it's a Roomba now) mopping machine instead of their relatively useless microfiber clothes. FWIW, these clothes have some sort of weird magic about them - they absorb dirt and suck it into the center of the cloth. Dunno how it works, BUT IT DOES. You can save money by flipping the cleaning clothes over and adding a bit of water to the ""unused side"". Both sides of this cloth clean well, and because of the way it sucks dirt into the middle of the cloth (and keeps it there), one side can be incredibly dirty and the other side can be totally fresh. If I'm running low on the clothes, I'll even soak them with water in the sink, squeeze them out (repeat a few times) and re-use them again by moistening them with febreze or some other cleaner or even just water if I want a light tile ""rinse"". You can get 4 uses out of each cloth (2 sides, use each side twice). My kitchen is fairly large, about 12x25, so these clothes are pretty cost effective. Do yourself a favor and shop around. You can save a lot of $ by buying multi-packs on Amazon. The price per cloth can vary dramatically depending on how you buy these things.",5.0

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,"Downy Ultra Fabric Softener, April Fresh, 129 Oz, 150 Loads",US,My experience with Downy April Fresh,"I know Downy since before I start live in United States. As a allergic person, I'm always trying new fabric products and essences to see which one is ok or not for me and for my family.About the ultra Downy April fresh:When I opened the bottle first time, the smell comes to me. I thought maybe it was to strong and cloying, but I wanted to see how it would be in the clothes.The aspect very liquid make me think for one moment that it was diluted and I will need more product to have the same result than others. But it is not true. The amount that you need is the same as usual, and the fact that it is more liquid makes the mix with the rinse water more easy. So, every piece inside the washing machine receives the fabric conditioner. Some capsule products don't do this.I used Downy in two different ways: first I left the clothes to dry in a open space by the sun and the wind, enjoying the warm weather here. In this case, after dry the clothes (and principally the towels) weren't so fluffy, but the smell on then was amazing. Every time someone open the closet the smell perfumes the entire house. I don't know if the product needs the hot of a dry machine to activate the softness on fabrics…On a second try, I dried the clothes on a dryer machine. This time, they were so much more fluffy then when I dried in a open space. The towels seem another kind of fabric after dry. But, on dry machine seem that the perfume are not so accentuate like in first case. I don't know if the heat do something on perfume… the clothes are smelling good, but are not perfuming the house.And about the perfume, even it seem very strong on bottle, it is not the kind of perfume that make me sneeze or provoke some allergic reaction.In conclusion: If I dry on open space and it leave the same strong perfume at fabric like when I use the dry machine, it will be the perfect fabric conditioner to me! But comparing with other brands and even other Downy products I have tried, this one is the best by now.",5.0

They are great for outside furniture, those plastic surfaces that are so hard to get clean. I never let myself run out of these. If you have something that is hard to clean, try a magic eraser. You may be surprised at how well it works.",5.0

First off, the smell is fantastic! It actually makes your laundry smell like they've been flapping in the country air all day! All 6 members of my family give the scent a big thumbs up! I was also surprised that Bounce truly did deliver on their 4-in-1 claim. My laundry definitely has less static cling and wrinkles, but the biggest surprise is the softness!

The smell is VERY CHEMICAL like. Imagine regular febreze when it first came out. The ORIGINAL bleh scent. Then times that scent by 12 and toss in something that smells like melted plastic. What you have here is THAT and it is NASTY. I am a HUGE fan of Febreze One. This is UNSTOBBALE GARBAGE. The smell will make you sick if you have a discerning and discriminating nose. I can only imagine the people who have given it 5 stars either have no sense of smell or used it in VERY dirty places so anything was better than what they were smelling. My pantry box was packed well, but the nozzle on this was turned open and dribbling and then I pushed the trigger and it just POURED on my hand. I IMMEDIATELY went to the sink to wash it and I kid you not, 15 hand washes later I can still smell it on my skin. WITH LOTS OF SOAP AND WATER. That's just gross on top of the awful scent. I bought this based on the reviews alone, the first time a fiveish star rated product has let me down. For what it is -original febreeze on mega chemical steroids, its overpriced. If the shipping didn't cost so much I would send this right back, still might. My advice is DO NOT BUY IT BASED ON THE REVIEWS HERE, smell it in the store FIRST or be prepared to get sick-for what it did to my hand I would HIGHLY ADVICE against using around children or pets or the elderly!.",1.0

I tried these Swiffer Sweeper Wet Pads in lavender vanilla and was very impressed. The pads attach to the sweeping pole in the same easy manner as the dry pad where you pinch the four corners into the sweeper. The wet pads also have a pleasant odor without being overpowering. You get hints of the lavender vanilla versus a strong perfume. When Swiffer says 'wet', they really do mean it as these pads are not like your typical wet wipe, but truly soaked and give you a thorough cleaning. What's worked best for me is to do a run through with the dry pad first to collect the large hairballs and dust collections and then I switch over to the wet pad for a clean finish. I use two pads for approximately 1200 sq. ft. of kitchen, dining and hallway and am very satisfied with the overall clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0

Best change ever! My clothing comes out clean, soft and smelling fresh every time! I have tried several softeners/enhancers over the years, but Downey is my go to. I always know that my cloths will come out of the dryer consistently smelling clean and feeling soft. I love the scent choices and that during certain seasons, like Christmas, I can find scents that go with that theme. However, I usually find myself just reaching for the clean laundry scent. I use it on a daily basis (I have seven family members whose laundry I do) and I never have to work about static or fabric pilling. There have been a few times I have forgotten to use it in the wash, and I end up washing my clothes again because they are full of static and they just do not smell as clean. I highly recommend Downey over other products. I have tried others and have found that Downey provides the most consistent softness, cleanliness, static-free-ness, and keeps my clothing looking like new longer.

I only used a tiny bit so didn't notice any smell when I put the detergent in the wash. However, once I took the clothes out I noticed a strong and unpleasant fragrance. When I went to look at the ingredients for the full product on Amazon, I saw that there are WAY more ingredients than what was listed on the samples, including fragrance. Now I'm just hoping that washing the clothes again with my regular detergent will get the terrible smell out. Why in the world would you put fragrance like that in something that is supposed to be gentle for babies? I threw away the remaining samples and will NEVER buy this product for myself or my baby.

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer Sweeper Dry Sweeping Cloth Refills, 48 Count",US,JOIN THESE WITH iRobot BRAAVA!,"The reviews are very good. However, if you want to stand thoroughly amazed at the ability of these Swiffer cloths, get yourself an iRobot Braava! The Braava works mysteriously well using your ceiling as its guide and covers every square inch of our kitchen, our entrance hall, and our large sun porch. All one has to do is move the radio beacon to each room to make sure the radio waves can ""see"" the ceiling, set in a new Swiffer dry cloth and turn this wonder on. The kitchen is done in about fifteen or so minutes of QUIET efficiency. It is QUIET and VERY good! I change the cloths for every room and am really shocked at minute coffee grounds, cat hair, and general STUFF that these cloths get up with so little effort from ME! I bought the Braava on Amazon and now continue to buy the Swiffer cloths here as well. Now, you think all THAT was good news? This iRobot ALSO wet mops with Swiffer wet cloths! So in a two step process, I dry mop and then tuck in a Swiffer wet cloth and turn this robotic maid on again. NO MORE steam mop except very rarely, just for sure sanitation. Only one of our cats was suspicious of this new mopping style and he is fine with it now after several days of watching every single move of the robot. And the Braava weighs less than ten pounds, has an easy grab handle and it's simple to tuck in the dry or the wet cloths. With eight rods and other assorted horrors in my back, two bad knees and on and on and on (and a well earned phobia of people coming in to clean our house for us!), the floors on the main level which aren't carpeted, are now EASY to maintain. Of course there is no going back now. That would be the most stupid decision I've EVER made! Sometimes the ONLY bother is to run the Braava twice through a room with the radio set in another location. Some bother!",5.0

They're not quite as effective in terms of softeness but they perform phenomenonally in the areas of scent and static reduction. This is the sole reason for the 4 stars...

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,"Tide Pods He Turbo Laundry Detergent Pacs Tub, Free And Gentle, 81 Count",US,"Great detergent, great price!","I have extremely sensitive skin and developed many contact allergies. I was reacting to any detergent that was scented as well as many other household products and had hives and rashes everywhere for a while before finding out the cause. When first diagnosed with these issues, I immediately got the holistic, super organic detergents, which improved my skin greatly but did not do so much for my clothes. I had always had great luck with regular tide pods for cleaning clothes but couldn’t use them with my skin, so when I saw they had a free and gentle version, I was curious to try it out. I will admit I was skeptical; I wasn’t sure that the detergent would be strong enough to clean, and also wasn’t sure that it was gentle enough for my extremely sensitive and allergic skin. But being that I felt like all of my clothes were essentially unwashed, I gave it a go. At first, I would do a normal wash cycle and then an extra rinse cycle just to be sure that the detergent was washed off really well and didn’t cause a reaction in my skin. It cleaned extremely well and no reactions at all! Eventually, as my outbreaks started to clear up, I tried doing just a regular wash cycle and again, have been totally fine! Recently I borrowed a friends sweater that was washed in scented detergent and developed a rash so I can attest to the fact that a) my allergies are still very much there and b) that this stuff is very much free and clear. For a clean freak like me, it’s amazing to get a good wash and still be easy on my skin! As far as pricing, Amazon has been great with this item. It can be pricey in stores and hard to find in larger quantities, so you are paying more per count. I do subscribe and save and am very happy with that. Additionally, Amazon sometimes has coupons for it as well. Thanks tide for making a great product for those of us with sensitive skin and allergies!",5.0

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,DOWNY LIQ CLEAN BREEZE 40LD  34OZ,US,Pleasantly Surprised with Downy,"I stopped using fabric softeners many years ago due to the overwhelming scent triggering my asthma. I gave this one a try to see if there were any improvements in the formulas and, delightfully, there were. The scent is very light and fresh after the clothes come out of the dryer. I washed my sheets and pillow cases and had no trouble breathing. The product measurement instructions were not all that clear and the cap itself is not clearly marked. I measured to where the cap starts to swirl and filled the reservoir to the top with water. I definitely didn\u2019t use too much because the scent was not overwhelming. I was also looking for softer, less wrinkled clothes since I frequently throw in a load before I leave for work. I did notice an improvement in that some items could be worn right after sitting in the dryer for 10 or more hours. 100% cotton blouses still needed to be wrinkle-released. Jeans were noticeably less stiff. Even though I wash all my clothes in cold water, fading is an issue. I wear a lot of black. Four weeks isn\u2019t enough time to assess this product\u2019s success with reducing fading or pilling. Even if it doesn\u2019t help with fading I think it\u2019s still worth it for the softness aspect (especially towels and sheets) and for having fewer wrinkles to deal with.

It's personal choice which is why I still give it 4 stars. These pads do the job. Clean up any mess, if you get the scented ones it leaves a nice light smell to the area you clean. You get about one rooms worth of cleaning out of one pad in heavy use areas. Rooms that don't have a lot of foot traffic you can easily do at least two rooms. Now the reason I am falling out of love with Swiffer is because some other cheaper, no name wally brand actually works out better for me. Other brand has thicker pads that have a texture to them which seems like it cleans better. It has the green scrub area on both ends of the pad. They have a better wet solution that doesn't turn soapy as you use it. I've noticed Swiffer pads leave a sort of soapy residue behind. Other brand just acts like a wet mop, which I prefer. I don't mind these when they go on sale but otherwise will stick with wally.",4.0

But then I thought I'll save some money and go back to useing my regular pod detergent, and then I noticed my Whites were not coming out clean white, even beddin with bleach weren't white, and I couldn't figure out what's wrong? My washer and dryer are only a year old! I wash all whites in Hot water, my detergent and with bleach and nothing was working, and so one nite my son said ma can't you smell that bleach? I can smell it upstairs on the second floor? I felt so bad because anyone could have gotten sick, ! My washer & dryer are in my livening house, not in my cellar! So I said that's it! I was trying everthing and I over used bleach, which is very harmfull ,now I measure how much I use! And I figured out that hey I'm going back to useing Tide pod detergent! I never noticed a difference until I switched from my brand to Tide and then I wanted to save some money and go back to my cheaper brand clothes detergent, but that's when everything change, and I realized my brand was not cleaning as good as Tide! Seriously, I grew up where you were taught to pick and choose ,, buy wisely! Names didn't mean it's a better product, ! But Tide just Works much better, so if I have to pay more well my clothes, bedding etc. are worth it! We pay enough on them , To purchase them! So now I 'm gonna clean them Right the first time! I seriously had to have a talk with my husband , because we both were brought up to spend money wisely and store brand were just as good as big brand names, well we still believe that, read ingredients! But We will stick with Tide pod Detergent from now on, its worth it to have nice clean , fresh smelling whites right from my washing machine! No more washing everything twice! Tide works! All you have to do is get over the price and realize your worth it, , ! Thanks,I really hope this helps viewers! Good luck . Thanks K.Reddin",5.0

After a recent family trip to the beach, a final load of laundry was done with my brother's clothes, my parents' clothes and my clothes. My mom and I were talking about how our things that were odorless somehow now smelled like mildew and weren't sure if it was from the washing machine, or risking our clothes by including my brother's items! We decided it was probably him as she's had a tough time washing his items in hot water with vinegar to try to remove the stink from them. I was ready to try a similar method when I thought there had to be an easier, more effective way. Enter Amazon with the Odor Rescue pods. I'm a huge fan of Tide - I use it exclusively and was excited to see the positive reviews. I quickly ordered, used on the stinky clothes and was pleasantly surprised to find it truly rescued my items! I logged back on today not to write this review, but to order my mom some of these and decided I needed to say some nice words about this product.

The ""Attacks even 7 day old stains?"" not sure what it means but I tested that theory out on a white cotton t-shirt I used to wipe up some oil i spilled which changing the oil on my jeep. OK i didnt expect this to really get the oil out, just wanted to see how much it could get it out. The shirt washed just fine but as expected the dark oily splotches faded a little but were mostly still there. Ok so I can be amused by ridiculous advertising sometimes and the nature of 7 day old stains was just bothering me. So, I waited 3 more days (because I didn't have the patience to wait a full six) and I washed the shirt again and to my surprise, there was no change. The stains were still there and it hadn't even ben 7 days later. As a contrasting experiment I used Gain and washed the short again with a bunch of socks and you know what, the darn Gain made a huge difference on the stains beyond the 7 day mark. Its doubtful in most cases you will use a shirt to wipe up an oil spill but you will spill oily things on your shirt and don't be fooled by this ridiculous notion this Tide is any different than any other laundry detergent is claims to be better than. The 7 day old stain is a worthless bit of marketing and unfounded. Buy Gain if you want something that I have proven to myself does in fact work better than Tide AND smells much better.",1.0

I had never used the liquid Tide pods prior to this and I like them a lot! Combining the detergent with the Downy was a great idea, except we don't think our clothes are as soft as they are when we use liquid Downy (which is the brand I always use) separately. Unless it's super concentrated, I would guess there might be less in the pod? I'm not quite sure. I feel the clothes are retaining their brightness, are clean, and smell nice. I seem to notice the most difference in our towels. I use two pods and wash in hot water and they seem more fresh and clean than they have been. I've had no issues, yet, with pods not dissolving completely in hot or cold water. I use one or two depending on the load. I do add additional liquid Downy because, as I mentioned above, we don't find the clothes to be as soft as we like with just the pod.

It makes the job of picking up dust and dirt so much simpler than the traditional broom and mop combo. I keep my Swiffer on a hook right outside the kitchen door so I can grab it every night or two for a very quick once-over - SO much easier to do this ongoing maintenance than doing a ""big"" mop once a week. I especially like the Lavender Vanilla Wet Pads - they have an improved texture that really grabs all the dirt, and the light scent is very pleasant. It doesn't leave you with a ""hospital sterilized"" smell the way some cleaners do, it's just warm, clean, and inviting without being overwhelming. These pads also seem extra-wet which I appreciate - they cover a large area without drying out. With a 1 year old running around this product is a lifesaver for me!

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,Swiffer Sweeper Dry Sweeping Cloths Mop And Broom Floor Cleaner Refills Febreze Lavender Vanilla & Comfort Scent 32 Count,US,A convenient way to get & keep your floors clean,"I think one of the best things about this product is the convenience factor. This is great for light cleaning & maintenance. The entire system is pretty easy to handle, you just hook the cleansing pads onto swiffer & mop like you normally would. I will say that I absolutely love the scent of the Lavender Vanilla. It actually scented my home for the whole day giving it a warm relaxing aroma. There's also a scrubber on the edge of the pads for any small stains you have but I found the scrubber was a little difficult to situate- I did have to somewhat align the actual wet pad with my hand to get the scrubber on the area I needed it to. Although I plan to repurchase the wet pad refill, I wouldn't replace it w/ my usual mop & bucket cleaning. I find this personally worked best for in-between maintenance simply because, I found that I needed to change the swiffer pad multiple times while mopping my kitchen. I found this especially true during snow storms & finding salt residue on my floors. It made no sense to keep a dirty pad on the swiffer to keep mopping (I mean you're just pushing a dirty pad across the whole floor) so after changing it multiple times, It just feels like I'd get a better clean using my traditional mop & bucket. I would however use this as a refresher during the week to maintain a shiny clean floor or for small mishaps. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,Swiffer Wetjet Floor Mop Starter Kit (Packaging May Vary),US,Good --- But I have Reseravtions About It,"Well, I was a little disappointed. The spray is so much, so fast. Do not press the button twice, it put out so much liquid it was way too wet for way too long. I had to use paper towels to dry the floor after that. It also seemed to dull my Bruce real-wood floor, I used cloth towels to restore the shine a bit. It did fairly good on porch tile floor, and best of all on an old fashioned vinyl floor. It leaked cleaning fluid in streams when I lifted it off the floor. Not happy, got it over a trash can and let it run in that. Basically, I think I would have been better off with a normal swiffer and a spray bottle of some kind of cleaning liquid -- something I could control, and which would be a lighter mist on the floor, not a stream of liquid.",4.0

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,"Tide Pods He Turbo Laundry Detergent Pacs Tub, Free and Gentle, 81 Count",US,"very useful, good for sensitive skin","I'm surprised, but I really really like these. I didn't love using the Tide Free and Gentle liquid laundry detergent all that much; it seemed to either fail to get things clean or to leave a bit of soapy residue, so I guess it was mainly a struggle of finding the right amount of detergent per size of load. For whatever reason, these pods are much more forgiving of laundry load size. I sometimes use 1 and sometimes 2 pods per laundry load, and I haven't noticed an issue. HOWEVER one time during a load a pod got stuck in the channel at the front of the front load washer, where it drains, and I had to re-run that load because the clothes didn't have enough soap on them to clean them and yet there was soap left all over the front channel and inside of the door, but I've used 3/4s of the package, and that's only happened one time, so I full intend to keep using these. A reminder: these can be very dangerous with kids in the house, as they can be easily eaten and swallowed by children and can seriously injure them if swallowed. However, I actually like these BECAUSE I have kids in the house: so long as I keep them safely out of their reach when laundry isn't being done, I love being able to pull the package down so my child can pull one out and put it in the washer, and that way he can help more with the laundry in a way he never could with liquid detergent, and he really loves being able to help with little chores like that.",5.0

I am a person who likes prominent, strong scents and this Downy provided that. I did 3 separate loads to test it on different types of clothes and temperatures. The first load was sheets, underwear, socks, and towels. With the exception of one pair of my daughter's socks (I don't think a product exists that can make her socks smell perfect), everything else smelled amazing. The next load was whites. Equally came out of the dryer smelling fresh and pleasant. The 3rd load was colors, and once again, the Downy fabric softener did not disappoint. It's been 3 days since I washed everything, and I'm happy to report that the scent is still potent and there. It's not as strong as it was on day one, but everything still smells fresh and clean.

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,"Ultra Downy April Fresh Liquid Fabric Softener, 51 Fl Oz",US,Downy - A Simple Classic,"Whenever I think of liquid fabric softener, I always think of that iconic blue bottle of Downy. It's exactly what you'd expect a top-of-the-line fabric softener to be - a product that gets my clothes conditioned while making everything smell amazing (including my house!). To be specific, I used the 34-ounce size of Ultra Downy April Fresh. I like that it's concentrated and that I didn't have to pour a lot to get its full benefits. As a disclaimer, I know that some people might be sensitive to fragrance, and I wouldn't recommend this product to them. Other than that, this product is a great addition for anyone who uses liquid fabric softener, and I'd tell them to buy it without hesitation.When I'm reviewing products, I always like to include the backs of the bottles, just so people can see the usage directions and get the feeling you'd get if you were to walk into the store and pick up the bottle to examine it (because the front label IS pretty, but it's not very informative to a discerning consumer, like me).

I was right. I just drop the packs into my wash and no measuring or spilling. There's only one flaw, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars: the packs are very fragile where the Downy is stored. The membrane is very thin and almost punctured when I took it out of the orange plastic container. I planned to take only the number of pods I needed to my laundry room, but their delicate nature means I'm going to have to take the entire orange container with me (or put them into a separate, smaller plastic container) to keep them from leaking in my laundry bag.",4.0
Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,Tide PODS Ocean Mist HE Turbo Laundry Detergent Pacs 72-load Tub,US,So convenient and easy to use.,"I received this product for free in return for an honest review. When laundry pods first came out, I was very reluctant to try them. I was strictly a liquid laundry detergent girl. When I received my Tide Pods, I was excited to try them. I like them for many reasons. First, they work great! Great at cleaning and have a nice scent. Also, they are more convenient and less messy to use. They are also easier to store in that they do not take up a lot of room. Also, you know exactly when you will run out, i.e., how many are left. With liquid, it's a guessing game as to when the liquid will run out as you can't see through the bottles to see how much is left. When you buy a bag of 16 or 20, you know exactly how many loads of laundry you can do before you run out. So, yes I will be using Tide pods again. I really liked them.

When I purchase fabric softener, I look for products to help maintain the quality of clothing, soften clothing, smells great, and keeps the pesky static away without breaking the bank. However, I normally end buying multiple products to get what I want in a fabric softener and usually go over my budget; but not anymore! Ultra Downy Clean Breeze has it all! The scent is sweet, refreshing, and long lasting; because of this, I no longer have to buy multiple products or use scent boosters to achieve great smelling laundry (which saves me money).

My clothes are much softer and I notice there is much less static, which is important to me and the scent just can't be beat. Since I like to buy clothes with the intent of wearing them a long time, I am excited to use something that protects fabrics from pilling, fading and stretching.

Dawn being put into dishwasher gel tablets is so nice too, since Dawn Original d/w liquid cannot be beat for handwashing or doing dishes by hand. I prefer to do my dishes in my dishwasher and these gel tabs rarely have not done a great job cleaning my dishes and pots. I am glad I am able to order Cascade ActionPacs online and have them shipped to my home. It saves me time and energy that I no longer have to spare, even though I am retired now. There are so many things I enjoy doing that I can do by simply not shopping locally anymore.

It has a good fresh clean scent to it that is noticeable in your clothes but not overpowering. I am really impressed with pouch it comes in. It is easy to use, easy to pour, the pouch has a spout with a screw top cap. You can use this pouch to refill a traditional bottle or just use the softener straight out of the pouch and get rid of those huge clunky bottles that take up tons of space. The pouch strands up on it own so you could store it on a shelf but is flexible so it can fit in the pedestal drawer under my washer that won't fit a traditional bottle (big plus for me). I also like that the pouch takes up less space not only in my laundry room but also in my trash can. I hate throwing away big plastic bottles that take up all my room in the trash can, this is completely flat when empty. Makes me feel better when I'm producing less trash and less going into landfills. The only negative thing I can think of is there is no cap to measure, this doesn't bother me because my washer has a fill line for softener but just be aware if your someone who relays on the cap for measuring you might want to hold onto a cap from something else. Overall I am very happy with this product and very pleased with the new pouch packaging for its ease of use and its ability to be stored in s smaller place where traditional bottles won't fit.",5.0

They also boast numerous advantages over their less versatile alternatives. Firstly, they have a much higher propensity to latch on to and help capture dust, allergens and various contaminates on a wide variety of surfaces that would otherwise be pushed around by cheaper alternatives such as the aforementioned papers or cloth. Secondly, they will alleviate allergens and those whom have a heightened sensitivity to various irritants such as dust mites, pet hairs and the like. Additionally, though they are primarily for use with the swiffer sticks, they can just as easily be utilized as free standing dusting cloths by hand.

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,"Downy Ultra Fabric Softener Free and Sensitive Liquid, 40-Load (34 fl. oz.) Bottle (Pack of 6)",US,NO SCENT EVEN WORTH DISCUSSING!,"DOWNY ULTRA FABRIC SOFTENER FREE AND SENSITIVE: Ok, there is no problem with the slight, slight, slight aroma. And I can be very sensitive to poignant odors. NO big deal as Downy Free smells very, very little and is quite non-offending and, if anything, just smells CLEAN! And, please note that any scent is GONE once your clothes leave the dryer or are hung to dry. I like that the liquid is WHITE instead of the blue of regular Downy because my front load washing machines have always had a white dispensing pull-out tray and the blue made a mess to clean up after every single wash! The white on the white (there's never a big mess!) can wait until my major cleanup once a month, yes, to make sure there is no mold growing anywhere inside or on the outside of the slide-out tray dispenser. YUCK! But true and it does happen with front loading washing machines and one must just allot time to clean it at least once a month! But a front loading machine is proven gentler on clothes and mine never gets out of balance. Downy softener softens clothes is as good as it gets, but on certain items, I do add a dryer sheet in with a load in the dryer if I need extra softening. I order six of these at a time as my grocery store doesn't carry the Downy Free which would make a trip to Target to get a container or two every three or so weeks.",5.0

Home Care,Febreze,Air Care,Febreze One Fabric and Air Mist Starter Kit,US,Better than the aerosol,"I am typically not a febreeze person. To me, no matter what scent I had tried in the past, they always had this weird after smell that I just didn't like. So, I have just stayed away from them and would occasionally try a new scent maybe once a year or so, but again always had that weird smell to it, so I would be disappointed. I decided to give these non-aerosol sprays a try and I must say I do like them a lot better than the aerosol cans. When you pull the trigger back and then let go, it continues to spray for a few seconds. its not like a typical pump spray where it just bursts put when you push the pump and thats it. This one will keep going for a few seconds after you let go of the trigger, so you can do the whole 'wave your arm around to get the spray everywhere' thing. The nice thing about these is that you can use them on furniture/upholstery etc and in the air. I do like these scents a lot better because they don't have that odd febreze smell to them. The scent is a bit lighter than the aerosols, but it does have staying power and smells good. Its almost like a more natural smell than the heavy perfume-y smelling aerosols. The just smell fresh and clean and more like youre eliminating odors instead of piling air freshener on top of them. Another small bonus to them is that theyre quiet when using them. You wont hear them spraying like you hear an aerosol can. So, you can quickly and quietly spray as needed without someone hearing you spray it ... if you're trying to be discrete or sneaky to get rid of an odor, etc. I will continue to buy the refills. The set comes with 2 triggers and 3 bottles of spray. I keep one downstairs and one in my bedroom. I am curious to see what other scents are available as refills.",5.0

I mainly use these on my porcelain coffee/tea cups that stain & I used to have one in each shower for hard water stains. I ran the eraser around the rim of a mug and it literally cut the thing in half. I am writing this review after wiping my finger tips over one to get some wite-out off and that action (slight rubbing) shredded the eraser!!! I think this is a prime example of reducing the quality to sell more product. I bought the ""Extra Power"", extra durable version of the.magic eraser and they are the worse box ever.

I wouldn't say 2 weeks, but definitely over a week. I think these are a little expensive but I personally think it's worth it. One of my neighbors asked what laundry detergent I use cause that's what she's getting too. Now the laundry room is starting to smell a lot better lol. I can't wait to try the other scents but I've heard that this is the best one. I have never had problems with the pellets not fully dissolving. Even when I only use cold water, they always dissolve fully. I've also found other uses for this and one of my favorites is putting a few pinches in a mesh bag and throw them at the bottom of the kitchen trash can before the trash bag. This helps mostly when switching out bags. We have a baby which equals diapers. When it's time to take the garbage out that woosh of diaper and old food can be way too foul.

My dishes were not getting clean, my dishwasher smelled bad. I took it apart to clean it and there was a gummy red film all over the bottom of the filter area as well as pieces of the gel covering. I started unwrapping them, taking the red ball out and cutting them in half since Miele's are not supposed to needs as much detergent. Then my dishes were just not getting clean. I finally used them all and will not be buying anymore. Bought a small packet of Cascade Platinum pods at Walmart just to test and they are FANTASTIC! My dishes have never been cleaner and my dishwasher doesn't smell funky anymore! I was concerned because they also have the dissolving covering on the detergent, but so far so good.

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,Downy Unstopables Fresh In-Wash Scent Booster Fabric Enhancer 26.5oz,US,Turned me into a believer....,"I'm a guy. What do I know about laundry. However, I do keep on top of new products being introduced to the marketplace. This product by Downy was a featured product that appeared on my Twitter feed. I kind of liked the fact that it promised to freshen the scent of clothes, and keep them scented for days on end. So, I took a chance. i bought a bottle from Amazon. Inside the bottle are little blue pellets. You can put as many or as little as you want in with your wash. I chose not to go hog-wild. I put about a half a cup of pellets in with a small load. I must say, while the wash was in process, I could smell the fragrance from the next room. It was as if someone unleashed an air freshener in my home. Once I dried the clothes, I let them sit for a complete day, and then did a sniff test... Sure 'nuff, I was able to detect a whiff fresh fragrance in my towels, underwear and shirts. It wasn't overly strong, but anyone getting close enough to my clothing would probably be able to pick it up. Personally, I kind of wish that Downy would have combined a softener agent along with this freshener. However, for what the product is, I am very satisfied. I am going to be putting these pellets in every load I do moving forward. Highly recommended.",5.0

I have more or less followed family tradition in using Tide; it is generally a great product and worth the money. My mother used it in our Westinghouse Laundramat washer in the early 1950s and beyond. I followed the tradition because it seemed to work the best. The only bad experience I had was with Tide XK, in about 1969. I had rashes and skin flareups like mad. All the detergent makers had switched and I had to go back to using SOAP FLAKES (Lux, Citrus, or White King). Things got better and I used Tide again. I tried these pods in both a top-loader LG, and had the incomplete dissolving problem so many mention on here. And, yes, I put the pod in the bottom of the machine before loading. Because I didn't like it, I replaced the LG with a Whirlpool front-loader. The same issue: the packets don't dissolve completely. I could place them at the rear of the drum, the front, or half way: same issues. There have been NO issues with other brands of pods; all have dissolved, none have left globs on the clothing.",1.0

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,"Ultra Downy April Fresh Liquid Fabric Softener, 51 Fl Oz",US,Average Fabric Softener,"When I first opened the bottle of Downy April Fresh Liquid Fabric Enhancer, I was a bit concerned with the scent. I found it overpowering and generally not the type of scent that I am usually drawn to for laundry products (I love the Botanical Mist scented Downy products). However, I found after using the product in the wash, the scent isn't overpowering on freshly washed clothing. I think the product does help with softening fabric. I have generally tried to reduce household products with heavy scent, dyes, and other chemicals, but still find myself reaching for Downy with items such as sheets, towels, and jeans, because they feel crunchy and uncomfortable when I don't use it. My sheets and towels also feel much fresher when I pull them out of the closet a week after a wash compared to when I don't use Downy. Jeans and other clothing items are noticeably less wrinkly when I use Downy. I do not care for the fact that all of the ingredients used in the product aren't disclosed. Some simply say dye, perfumes, etc. This gives me great concern, because if Procter & Gamble feels the need to keep them off of the label, I automatically think that there must be a reason for it. With my children's skin being exposed to the fabric in their clothes and sheets pretty much all of the time, I'm unwilling to use this product on their items. All in all I think this is a decent product, but I am giving a rating of 2/5 because I do not care for the scent and because of concern over the ingredients used.

The fan is VERY loud, louder than any space heater I have ever owned, even those with fans. 2. The fan NEVER turns off! Once the room reaches temperature, the heater elements are off but the fan continues running and it is extremely loud! Basically, once the room reaches a set temperature, I have to get up and manually turn the power button off. When the room gets cool again, I also have to get up to turn it on. Extremely annoying.

The plastic part clings to the clothes and then hardens in the drier. I have an old HE front load whirl pool. I thought it might be an issue with my washer but I googled the issue and others seem to have the same issue. It has happened on very heavy loads as well as light loads so it's not an overloading issue. It's happened in cold and hot washes as well so it's not a water temperature issue. I have been able to get each one out by soaking in hot water until I run the wash again, but it's a real pain to have to soak and wash items twice. I don't have time for that (whole reason for buying the pods) and I'm terrified that I'm going to come across a garment where I cannot get the melted pod out. The tide does do a good job on keeping our clothes clean; however, the clothes do not come out smelling great. The clean smell is very faint. I started using the Laundress detergent for dark clothes and the smell and soft feel is just divine. I'm going to switch over to their standard detergent and give that a try instead.",2.0

I then go back with the dry swiffer to get anything remaining which you can see is a lot! It's gross to think I just swept before and occasionally mopped. With this system it makes it easy to keep my kitchen and bathroom floors clean and sanitary. After I sweep and dry cloth I use the wet clothe. I bought a 2 box pack from Amazon for $12. Some people say they rip you off on refills. But I bought both dry and wet in 2 box packs from here which to me make it more reasonable. I hope the pictures help make up your mind on this. I love how easy and effortless this is versus bringing out a heavy duty mop every time I sweep, which isn't going to happen for me . Please like if you found helpful:)",5.0

I expected a refreshing pine smell at least for a while, and it did smell nice but didn't last. It seemed like the smell dissipated when it dried. I re-sprayed and did give everything a good soaking. It lasted longer but I finished the first can. I will go back to other Fabreze smells they seem to linger much longer by comparison and put a fresh wreath in the living room.",2.0

Home Care,Febreze,Air Care,FBRZ ONE Refill Bamboo 1/4x300mL,US,Smell what I’m saying,"With two cats in the house, an open window or a can of deodorizer or scent is never an unwelcome thing. Although we tend to lean more toward a disinfectant or antibacterial spray, Febreeze is a market leader and we figured it was worth a try. The description of this kit was a little misleading, as in at least one place, it indicated that you needed to buy a sprayer that was sold separately. I thought, though, that if it said “kit”, that meant it contains everything you need, which indeed is the case (see photo, showing two bottles with sprayers attached and one refill bottle). The product is easy to use, as the sprayers are the manual type that ejects a nice spritz of light mist when squeezed (see spray photo). Just spray in the area of offending odors and wait for the orchid or bamboo aroma to take over. It works great in the laundry room (where the cats’ litter boxes are) and in the master bathroom after a busy morning of prepping for work. In a pinch, it can tackle odors in the kitchen, though I don’t like to use fragrance chemicals in that area if I can help it. It can also be sprayed on fabrics and surfaces that may have some offending substance soaked in or spilled on them. Because it eliminates the odors and doesn’t just cover them up, it is very effective at reducing bad odors just about anywhere in the home. I was tempted to reduce the rating a little for the misleading information in the description, but I’ll put that penalty on Amazon and give this product the five stars it deserves.",5.0

Fabric Care,Gain,Laundry,"Gain Botanicals Plant Based Laundry Detergent, Orange Blossom Vanilla, 64 Loads 100 fl oz",US,New Favorite!,"I was kind of skeptical about this scent. I mean I heard of Gain and used it a few times at my in-laws house when we visit, but the scent was very citrusy with a hint of vanilla. I didn't think it the smell would last more than the normal scent. Well, I did my 10 loads of laundry. Now when you pour/smell from the cap, the scent is STRONG. After the clothes were done in the washer, the strong scent turned into a more warm soft citrus vanilla scent. I fell in love! My husband is also a smoker. So a lot of detergents don't take the smell out of his clothes...most of the time with out scent boosters. Well after the wash, I was impressed!! His clothes smelled clean!! He was pretty impressed and the scent on the clothes after they were dry, lasted a week. A lot longer than what I originally thought. The clothes smelled and looked clean, very impressed with Gain Bontonicals. I think I have found my go-to laundry detergent now :) .

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,Tide PODS Ocean Mist HE Turbo Laundry Detergent Pacs 81-load Tub,US,Wanted to love them....but they ruined our clothes.,"I wanted to love Tide pods because Tide is a name I have trusted to get out my kid's stains (4, 2 & Infant) but the plastic doesn't dissolve and the dye runs onto clothes, rendering them unwearable. I've been using Tide Pods for the last few months and seem to have a problem with a few loads of month. The tide pods have not been dissolving and as you can see from my picture, the plastic has melted onto several pieces of clothes, rendering them un wearable and the purple in the pods has also leaked onto clothing items and stained them. I understand that the dye is designed to wash out of clothes and if I re-wash the items several time, the dye will come out--however, doing laundry for a family of 5, I don't have the time to inspect every item of clothing before tossing it into the dryer and once it dries it sets. I have attached three items, and those were not the only things ruined. I wanted to love Tide Pods because of the ease of use but they are more of a hassle then they are worth, and they aren't cheap. I have always washed our laundry in hot water and used one pod per load so I know it's not a me problem. Buyers beware. I have contacted Tide directly but it takes 48 hours to respond.",1.0

What is so great about it is the aroma last a long time and you don't have to use that much. I'm now on my second can. It cost more than I usually want to spend, but consider how long the scent stays in the air and not having to spray half a can I feel I'm actually saving money.

Home Care,Cascade,Auto Dishwashing,Cascade Complete All-in-1 Gel Dishwasher Detergent with Bleach Hydroclean A,US,Little packages of majic,"I have used the liquid Cascade for years, but after buying a new dishwasher it started having problems running. It was like the top of the dishes weren't getting cleaned but the bottoms were. After doing some research I found out there was some kind of soap build up inside. So i ran gallons of vinergar through my dishwasher to clean it out. Then i started using these tablets and the problem never came back. I always hated trying to squeeze the last ounces out of the liquid bottles. These solve that problem and so many more. Not only do they come in a handy container but everything is premessured. Just put a cube into the soap tray and close the trap. It's that easy. The only word of caution I would use is to make sure that your hands are dry. It's true about the warning on the side about the packs dissolving in water. Wet hands activate it to break down too and you will have quite a mess in your hands if you just pulled your hands out the sink after pre rinsing. I am not one to pre rinse, that's what the dishwasher is for. So trust me when I say these work, because i put the dirtiest of dishes in my dishwasher and these amazing little tablets always seem to get the stuck on food off.",5.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,Swiffer 180 Dusters Refills Unscented 20 Count,US,Works very well,"I have been using Swiffer duster for many years. I have tried many different duster prior to Swiffer but when I found Swiffer it was better: 1. No matter how much dust I have, it never falls off. 2. When you are done, you don't have to figure out where to shake off the dust. You just take it off and toss it in the garbage. Very handy especially in the winter since I used to shake it off outside. However, when I shake it off in the yard I would see pieces of dust on the bushes. Not any more! 3. It is light and easy to maneuver. I use it for dusting everything from TV screens to blinds. 4. It is unscented. 5. If the house is not too dusty, I can get a couple of uses from each duster. One of the duster is fluffy side and the other of the side which has sleeves to slide onto the duster handle. The fluff does not go all the way around but that is not a problem as I dust with one side only. A note on price: The best price for the duster I found at Costco especially when they have a coupon for this item. Amazon price is pretty good but fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called ""Online Price Alert"".

Fabric Care,Gain,FABRIC ENHANCER,Gain With Freshlock Original Dryer Sheets 120 Count (Pack of 6),US,You get what you pay for,"We own a small day spa, so we end up doing a LOT of laundry every week. Because of that we are in a good position to really compare and contrast different laundry products. Over the last year or so we have discovered that dyer sheets are one of those products where you get what you pay for. You can find cheaper dryer sheets than this Gain variety out there, but in our experience these are well worth the small extra cost. First of all they actually perform as promised in all areas. They do a great job of eliminating static cling and they smell amazing. My wife is very sensitive to smells/perfumes and some laundry products just don't pass her smell test. They are either too strong or just not pleasant to smell. She flips out over the smell of Gain products. It's hard to describe just exactly what makes it so good, but it's one of those smells where you just want to take a piece of clothing out of the dryer and hold it up to your nose, then inhale deeply. It's a comforting, relaxing and just all around NICE smell. I have learned the hard way that you really can't use these sheets more than once. In fact for bigger loads of laundry, it's good to throw an extra sheet in for maximum static cling control and scent distribution. Also, overall these sheets aren't that expensive if you can grab a coupon here on Amazon or from the paper to use at your local store. If you have had trouble finding dryer sheets your really love and you haven't tried Gain, you should give them a shot. We use them exclusively and are more than happy with their performance and value.",5.0

Fabric Care,Bounce,FABRIC ENHANCER,Bounce Bursts In-Wash Scent Booster Outdoor Fresh 26.5 Oz,US,Best I have ever used,"First, I think it is important to mention that I know a good dryer sheet when I see one. There are 9 in my household and I do a whole heck of a lot of laundry. So, when I say that these are my absolute favorite that is saying a lot. I could smell these before I even opened the box. They claim to help control static, freshen, soften, and help reduce wrinkles. I can say for sure that they do the first three things and do it well. I did not notice much difference in wrinkles, but that could have something to do with how quickly I got around to folding the clothes. I do have to use two sheets in a single load to get the desired effect; however, it is probably only fair to mention that my loads of laundry are pretty big. The box clearly states that two might be necessary in large loads. An added bonus is that my laundry room smells amazing! I received these free from Bounce in exchange for my honest opinion.",5.0

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,Tide PODS Ocean Mist HE Turbo Laundry Detergent Pacs 72-load Tub,US,Forbidden Fruits,"These are everything I could need in my life! In college, I gotta do my own laundry. Laundry isn't exciting to do, nor is lugging a bottle of detergent that weighs a couple of pounds in one hand while carrying my dirty clothes bag in another down roughly one and a half stories, along with a bottle of softener too. Tide Pods make is easy for me to reduce this stress by just throwing the amount of Pods I need onto the top of my clothes and only having to carry one bottle down the stairs. While this may seem lazy of me, I'm sorry that I prefer to not struggle down a flight and a half of stairs to the basement for laundry. It makes so much difference in me being able to get down easier. Pods also help reduce the worry I have of spilling detergent on the washing machines on campus. Yes, I still have the softener to try and not spill, but it's one less thing to worry about. They also make it so that I don't have to measure out how much I need, as how much I need is the same in each Pod. If you have a kid about to go into college or know somebody about to go into college, please buy them or at least recommend that they get Pods rather than liquid detergent. It reduces mess and makes things simpler. Best of all, these are great for memes. Yes, you see this right: memes. Tide Pods are one of the greatest memes to have come out of my generation, and though I do not participate in the meme of it myself, it is part of my culture. And what better way to culture myself with my other youths than to own the Forbidden Fruits myself? Overall, these are awesome for when you need to do laundry! They're easy to carry, clean well with no mess, and are a wonderful meme part of my generation's culture. I reccomend these to everyone, as you all should be doing laundry at some point in your life; plus, they are a onderful meme. But please, don't become the meme itself.",5.0

It simplifies kitchen cleaning. These refills work great and I appreciate the convenience of ordering via Amazon and just keeping a package on hand. Some of these are scented. I've tried the lavender and turns out I prefer unscented as it was a bit harsh, but it also dissipates quickly so it was no bother.

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,"Downy Ultra Fabric Protect Clean Breeze Fabric Conditioner, 90 Loads, 77 Fl Oz",US,Pleasantly Surprised with Downy,"I stopped using fabric softeners many years ago due to the overwhelming scent triggering my asthma. I gave this one a try to see if there were any improvements in the formulas and, delightfully, there were. The scent is very light and fresh after the clothes come out of the dryer. I washed my sheets and pillow cases and had no trouble breathing. The product measurement instructions were not all that clear and the cap itself is not clearly marked. I measured to where the cap starts to swirl and filled the reservoir to the top with water. I definitely didn’t use too much because the scent was not overwhelming. I was also looking for softer, less wrinkled clothes since I frequently throw in a load before I leave for work. I did notice an improvement in that some items could be worn right after sitting in the dryer for 10 or more hours. 100% cotton blouses still needed to be wrinkle-released. Jeans were noticeably less stiff.Even though I wash all my clothes in cold water, fading is an issue. I wear a lot of black. Four weeks isn’t enough time to assess this product’s success with reducing fading or pilling. Even if it doesn’t help with fading I think it’s still worth it for the softness aspect (especially towels and sheets) and for having fewer wrinkles to deal with.

We have a large, busy household and use Cascade pacs to run at least one (but often more) loads each day. That's why, when my year old, high-end dishwasher stopped cleaning my dishes consistently- I was panic stricken! I began finding the PAC in the bottom of the dishwasher or congealed on my silverware, intact! Finally, I had had enough. I pulled out my warranty info only to find that my dishwasher was 13 months old! Just as I realized my HORRIFYING, hand-washing fate- my noble, not-at-all mechanically inclined, handsome knight came to my rescue! We spent the evening taking our dishwasher apart, rinsing filters, spinning gadgets and gizmos to no avail. I gave up and was making plans to call a repair co. first thing in the am. when my husband exclaimed, ""it HAS to be the soap?!"" Never even crossed my mind. An 11:30pm grocery store run for new detergent and sure enough... The FINISHing touch is all it needed! My dishwasher isn't broken! It's as good as new! My Cascade Platinum however, is NOT. Although I purchased it just one month ago, it is dated MARCH, 2016. Dishwasher Pacs have an expiration?!!? Who knew!?!

Home Care,Pampers,DIAPERS,Pampers Swaddlers Diapers Size 2 Giant Pack 132 Count,US,Huggies are by far my favorite. Yes,"I'm a Mom to 6 now, so I've had a lot of experience with diapers. I've used Pampers, Luvs, Huggies, Target brand, and a store brand once. Out of all of those diapers, Huggies are by far my favorite. Yes, hospitals typically use Pampers, and they're pretty good during the newborn stage, but once the baby starts to ""chunk up"" a bit, Pampers are a pain. Literally. The tabs are almost non-flexible plastic that always seem to dig in to the baby's thighs. Pampers have always been this way, and it's left me wondering why they haven't changed the design, all these years?? On the contrary, Huggies tabs are soft and flexible, and I've never had any of my babies have problems with them. They're very accommodating to chunky thighs. :) Aside from the tab design flaw, I absolutely hate the mesh liner in pampers--It tends to cling to the baby's bottom, which can't be that comfortable (so much for keeping them dry feeling??). There's also no leak guard near the back, like Huggies have, so it increases the likelihood that you'll see a blow out up the back. (Trust me, it'll happen.) Additionally, the Pampers Swaddlers equivalent, Huggies Little Snugglers, are amazingly SOFT, for a disposable diaper! Overall, Pampers Swaddlers are fine during the newborn stage. But thereafter, they are literally a pain. This is merely my opinion, and I'm not speaking on behalf of you, or anyone else, as I'm sure there are plenty of people who absolutely love Pampers over Huggies. :)",2.0

Fabric Care,Gain,LAUNDRY,Gain With Freshlock Original Powder Detergent 15 Loads 16 Oz (Pack of 3),US,"MORE TRUTH ABOUT THIS ""DASH"" BUTTON","Really great idea with lousy options and so I'll probably use this THIS silly device once, to get my $4.99 credit and then be done. Why? Because the Gain ""dash"" button inventory is VERY VERY limited to some of the most expensive Gain products on this website (per load). As it stands now, you can only select from about 4 Gain detergents and 3 Gain dryer sheets, manufactured by Gain. I like powder Gain and so I am stuck with a goofy 3-pack that equates 45 loads (15 loads per pack) for a WHOPPING $18 plus tax. Insanity! I can get same 45 loads in powder form WITH a scoop, priced at $6.99 at my local grocer. I don't have this kind of money to throw away over $10 for push button convenience/home delivery. There are tons of Gain powder options on Amazon and fairly priced at that, however, NONE of them are available for ""dash"" button users at this time... at all. Unless the options grow change fast, I'm tossing my dash and contributing to unnecessary plastic in our landfills. If I had known, in advance, of the narrow ""dash"" selections I would have never bothered. Returning item will be more of a hassle than just purchasing this powder once, getting it delivered and signing off. I still love Gain products though. Get my clothes super clean and smell great! I'll just drive or ride my bike to go get it like I always have and save myself over $10 per 45 loads.",2.0

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,"Downy Fresh Protect April In-Wash Odor Shield, 19.5 Ounce",US,"Under extreme testing, it works!","I estimate that use of this product reduces unwanted smell on synthetics by about 70%. I do combination of backpacking with restricted diet which produces ketones with horrendous smell. This has been a problem as at temperatures above 82 degree (28 degree C) ketones come out through the skin and get attached to synthetic clothes. Washing or soaking with regular detergents was absolutely ineffective, including detergents with bleach alternative. It would take at least a week for the smell gradually disappear from clothing left on a hangers. I desided to try this Downy Fresh Protect. A solid version of the product was chosen for its convenience for backpacking. Personally, I liked smell of the pink granules better than blue ones. The granules did not dissolve easily. I had to start preparation in advance by adding water to them and living them for half an hour to soften up, then finishing dissolving by stirring. The resulting solution wasn't transparent but looked somewhat like a milk. I used this solution to soak my already washed clothes and synthetic socks for about half an hour, and rinsed it off. The treatment did not completely illiminate smell retention but reduced it significantly. I was quite satisfied with the results.",4.0

Pros: long-lasting scent (even after sitting in my dresser for a week), helps reduce wrinkles in my work shirts, less fuzz and pills on my sweatshirts, soft towels and keeps the colors on my children's clothing bright. Definitely a useful product for myself and my kids. Cons: This product claims to help prevent static cling. However, in my experience I still had some static cling while using it, especially with towels. I had to throw the towels back into the dryer with a fabric softener sheet. This however is not a deal breaker and I still recommend this product 100%. Other than the prevention of static cling Downy April Fresh Liquid Fabric Enhancer delivers on all it's promises.

Fabric Care,Bounce,FABRIC ENHANCER,Bounce Bursts In-Wash Scent Booster Outdoor Fresh 26.5 Oz,US,"Fantastic crisp, fresh scent for all your laundry! Makes clothes soft and static free!","Let me just start by saying, that I LOVE Bounce dryer sheets in outdoor fresh scent!! They really do have a clean, fresh, crisp scent that lasts on your laundry for days. Upon opening the box, you can smell the heavenly fragrance throughout the entire room. Although the scent is strong, it is not overpowering at all. I have used unscented dryer sheets for years, ever since my daughter was a baby, because I was worried about irritating her sensitive skin. I had no clue what I was missing out on until I tried these dryer sheets! My clothes and towels smell so much nicer and fresher after using the outdoor fresh scented dryer sheets! I have also found that they are wonderful to use in your car for a nice, long lasting fragrance. I usually throw 2 sheets under the floor mats and the fragrance lasts a long time. They also work wonderfully in your child's stinky gym bag. My daughter plays softball and her cleats stink up the bag. After tossing a Bounce dryer sheet in there, however, the odor is eliminated. I love stepping out of the shower and grabbing a towel and breathing in the aroma while drying off! These are a fantastic addition to my laundry routine and have not irritated any of our skin at all after using them on all the laundry for a few weeks. I am definitely purchasing these again!

My roommate said it simply smelled like ""clean"". As in someone finished cleaning and doing laundry a day or two ago, type clean. In other words, subtle, but definitely still there. I leave my actual plug-in in the Low setting. High tends to flood the room and the scent often comes off as too strong. Low in a 15' x 20' room with 8ft ceilings gives me that subtle clean smell. I installed another in the bathroom. For one week I had it on Low setting on a plug that was always on. The smell was a bit too strong. I moved it to a plug that was only ""on"" when the lights were also powered, even on high settings, it was often too weak of a smell.

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,"Tide Pods Plus Febreze He Turbo Laundry Detergent Pacs Tub, Botanical Rain,",US,"Replaces our usual mix of Liquid Detergent, OxiClean & Softener - And yet it cleans better !","We have a very active two year old son and at the end of every day his clothes look like he's been through a Tough Mudder race or a food fight and no matter what brand of liquid detergent we used, it was always never enough. Hence our regular laundry routine involves using and carefully measuring portions of liquid detergent, OxiClean powder and a fabric softener do get a decent clean. We were skeptical that a single pod (or two for our large loads) would replace of that and provide a similar clean , let alone a better one. And we were in for a nice surprise ... USING THEM - We normally do our laundry once a week which means we have a large load and have to use two of these pods and do them on a warm wash cycle (see pics ) - The pods have three chambers filled with different colored liquids (main detergent, Stain remover & fabric softener. Side Note - They are so jello & squishy that both me and my wife had to resist the temptation to pop them - Really beats out the hassle of measuring and pouring detergent+Oxiclean+ Softener for us. It couldn't have been easier - It has a nice floral fragrance that smells fresh without being overly feminine - The pods container has a three-latch lid which should prevent toddlers opening them easily. CLEANING POWER - We were really surprised that these pods actually worked and cleaned better than our previous combo mix. You can visually tell the difference on how the whites & colors look more brighter - I have sweaty underarms which stain my light colored office formal shirts and these pods do a very good job of removing them - not a miracle , but certainly better than before and as much as you can hope to achieve without pre-soaking - Does an excellent job of removing food & mud stains from our son's clothes RECOMMENDATION - Even though it says it dissolves in all water temperatures, we use a warm wash cycle and put a darker/larger piece of clothing (like a jeans,towel or bedsheet) directly over the pods in the first layer to prevent a staining mishap CONS - At almost 30 cents per pod or 60 cents per wash cycle (for large loads) , it isnt the most economical way to wash your clothes. However if you factor in that it replaces our regular detergent + OxiClean Powder & Softener for a better clean - then the costs sort of even out FINAL THOUGHTS Despite our skepticism, these Tide pods really outdid themselves and provided a better clean than two of our previous detergents combined. Now they are definitely a bit more expensive than other detergents , however you are already using multiple combos like us (detergent+oxiclean+softener) then these pods make perfect sense and may also just turn out to be cheaper in the long run",5.0

It smells so good, I keep opening up the bottle, just to sniff it, it makes me feel calm & peaceful. It was like having an aroma therapy session, right in my own laundry room! What really impressed me was it’s cleaning power. I washed anything from blankets & blue jeans, to white socks & Tee’s. Everything came out so bright & clean. I decided to really put It to the test, & took it with me to wash my dirty rugs. Wow! I took a photo of Gain Botanicals in action, I could literally see it lifting the dirt right out of my rugs! I’ve never had a detergent get my rugs so clean as this Gain Botanicals did! Gain Botanicals is 65% plant based, backed by the USDA’s seal of “bio-based” seal on its label, made using renewable plant energy. Even the bottle itself, is made up of post consumer plastic & 100% recyclable! And if this all isn’t enough, it comes with a money back guarantee.

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,"Tide Purclean Liquid Laundry Detergent, Unscented, 100 Fl Oz (64 Loads)",US,"TRY IT, You will not be disappointed!","First let me say that I am a Gain Laundry Detergent fan. I love the scent and it gets the stench out of my husbands work clothes. God has blessed me with 3 beautiful special daughters, two of which are allergic to ANY type of artificial dye/colorant or flavors. This does not only apply to foods, this applies to EVERY freaking thing! I was struggling trying to figure out what in the world was still effecting my kids, I thought I had eliminated everything they were allergic to from their diet and anything in the house, including cleaners, soaps, lotions, markers - everything. One night as I am lying in the bed trying to enjoy some me time, as so many other moms do after everyone else has finally gone to sleep - it hit me like a ton of bricks. DUH - Gain has dye in it! So then I start stressing, what am I going to use? I need something to remove stink, stains but yet Free & Clear. I debated trying this, simply because regular Tide caused my husband to have rashes, long before kids came into the picture. Then I was concerned about the scent, as my kids also have asthma. Is it going to be too strong? After several weeks of searching and testing the smell of Free & Clear products (which by the way most of them smell very chemically - to say the least) I found this locally for only $5.99 and decided it was definitely worth the price to give it a try. AND I LOVE IT!!! My kids have ZERO reactions from it, it cleans and removes stench from towels, wash clothes AND my husbands nasty work clothes. I never thought I'd be buying Tide again - but here I am. PLEASE DO NOT EVER STOP MAKING THIS or CHANGE IT!!!! I would say I'd pay whatever to have this product, but I do live on a budget like most middle class Americans so please don't jack the price up so high I can't afford it. One last thing, it does not take very much per load, so if you measure it out like you would other detergents - you will overload your washer with suds, have to rewash and it will be too strong of a scent.

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,"Tide Pods Plus Febreze Odor Defense Laundry Detergent Pacs, Active Fresh Sc",US,Ghastly odor -- worse than dirty laundry -- even after extra rinse,"This product smells horrible. I used a single pod in my HE front loader along with unscented liquid laundry detergent. I used an extra rinse setting because I generally don't like scented laundry products and knew I wouldn't be happy with the smell of my laundry with only one rinse after using these. Well, even one extra rinse wasn't enough. As soon as my washer finished and I opened the door, I was greeted with the horrible smell this product left behind. I decided to put my load through an extra rinse and spin cycle and I could still smell this product on my clothes after that. I decided to dry the laundry, though, instead of going through another rinse cycle. After drying, the scent of the product on my clothes is mostly gone but I can still tell it's there if I put the fabric up to my nose. I'm not sure where one could keep these pods, either, unless one actually liked their scent. (For the record, to me they don't have the kind of scent one would normally associate with laundry products that are scented. They smell like some sort of industrial cleaning product.) With the pouch resealed and sitting beside my washer, my entire laundry room smells like this horrible product. Does this product actually eliminate odors from fabric or does it just cover them up with a stronger, noxious scent? I'm not sure. Even if they do contain some ingredient that effectively removes odors versus masking them, the scent they leave behind smells worse than my clothes usually smell prior to being washed.",1.0

Those math problems are hard, and you wouldn't believe the writin they have her doing. Anyways, Lavona has a terrible time with homework and she ends up throwing piles of crumpled papers on the floor before she gets even one finished to hand in. Earl spied these on Amazon. Just the thing! Instead of crumpling her papers, Lavona needs an eraser. A big one, with lots of magic! Earl ordered, and when it came it turned out to be a sponge. When you get it wet, it's full of soap! A pre-soaped sponge! Earl, I said, that's a sponge full of soap, not an eraser, and the magic ain't workin cause Lavona's homework is soaking wet! Earl's the smart one in the family, so we let him do the thinking for hard problems like this one. You know what he said? Bill, I don't think that's an eraser at all, but this bald guy on the box in white clothes gives me an idea. With this here pre-soaped sponge Lavona can write out her homework on the wall, then copy it to her paper when she's done. After that she can erase the wall with this here pre-soaped sponge. Genius!

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,Tide PODS Ocean Mist HE Turbo Laundry Detergent Pacs 81-load Tub,US,Goo in the washer and fused clothing. Not good.,"I have a front loading washer with a rubber gasket around the door. At the bottom of this gasket are three little drain holes so water will drain out into the bottom of the washer. When we bought this washer the salesmen said to always check these drain holes to make sure they drain to prevent that musty smell that front loading washers can get. The first time I used Tide PODS the clothes came out clean but when I checked the drain holes they were clogged with this slimy, sticky, camel snot like goo. Apparently the stuff they use to encase the detergent does not dissolve. I thought I would give it one more try. This time, no goo in the door gasket but a shirt of mine had a blue glue like stuff that actually stuck two parts of the shirt together. I had to peel the parts away and now have this blue residue that will not come out. It's fused into the fabric. I'm sure the dryer had something to do with that as I didn't catch it until it came out of the dryer. But why was it stuck to my shirt when it came out of the washer? I have returned the unused portion and am going back to the ""old fashioned"" powder or liquid detergent. I've used both and have never had to clean snot out of the washer or had clothing stick together and I can't see that the PODS cleans any better. Not impressed with Tide PODS.",1.0

For benchmarking, I went with a day of old dishes, without pre-cleaning. Nothing too crazy or baked-on, but at the same time, I didn't put clean dishes in the dishwasher to make them hot. I went with the normal cycle on my GE dishwasher, and let it do its thing. I'm not going to say ""OH! MY GLASSES WERE CLEANER THAN EVER"" but to be honest, they were pretty clear. I'm used to cups having kind of a whitish chalky residue on top, and there was none of that with these packs. At the same time, my bowls and dishes were totally clean. Nothing needed to be re-washed.

The regular disposable wet Swiffer pads worked, but required a significant amount of scrubbing if the spots dried before we could get to them, and like Sweet Brown says, ""nobody got time for that"". The perfect solution was to fill an empty plastic squirt bottle with Swiffer solution, pre-treat the spots & let sit for approximately 60 seconds before mopping with the disposable Swiffers. Works like a charm. The hardest part is the fact the caps at the top of the plastic containers are impossible to remove by unscrewing, so instead I must poke a large hole in the rubber stopper with scissors and forcefully squirt the solution into my squirt bottle. For safety, I label the squirt bottle (don't want the hubs to think it's water and squirt the ribs/chicken when grilling) and securely store the half empty punctured bottles to prevent accidental tipping.",5.0

All I can say is ""Oh My""!! I have always loved Tide and have been back and forth with many brands but I always return to the first love that works. This is it! So, so glad that Tide is going plant based. My towels have a very pleasant smell and not overpowering with fabric softener smell which is not good for my sinuses, and not good for my clothes either. This is very gentle, yet very cleaning. I can now use the cold water setting more with every wash, and reduce the heating of water. Now that's a plus. I love the fact that I can purchase this in the Pantry section, at a very reasonable cost compared to in the store. I would love to have a subscription to this Tide. I still like the reg Tide but without the fabric softener in it.Back together again!",5.0

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,Downy Unstopables Fresh In-Wash Scent Booster Fabric Enhancer 26.5oz,US,Great if you NEED a scent boost.,"I currently live in a country that does not treat its tap water. As part of that, I have issues with my clothes coming out of the wash still smelling dirty. I've worked through several combinations of detergent, baking soda, fabric softener, and scent boosters to finally reach a point where my clothes smell clean once they've been washed. One of those components that I've found to be crucial in this process is scent boosters. I've found the right detergent and fabric softener combo for my clothes to FEEL clean, but they still have a musky smell to them unless I use scent boosters. Downy is the only brand of scent booster that works with this combo. I thought I would try and save money by buying other brands, but I either had to use a metric ton of pellets/crystals/whatever in my wash to get any result, or no result would come no matter how much product I used. I DO NOT recommend this product if you already feel your clothes smell nice and clean when you wash and dry them. Unless you absolutely want your clothes to smell like this product, there is no need to waste your money on it. The only way I would recommend you use this is for washing clothing and/or linens that are about to go into storage, as it will help keep the musky smells at bay. For me, this product is necessary to mask the scent my country's tap water leaves in our laundry. If you find yourself in the same situation, try it out and maybe it will work for you.",5.0

I have used these clothes for over a year and a half, and I began to notice that even after washing (and using a different fabric softener), that my clothes were starting to retain that sweaty, stinky smell. I was just about ready to trash them when I decided to try the Downy April Fresh Liquid Fabric Enhancer. The scent in the bottle is not overpowering, and I didn't need to use as much as I suspected.My stinky old gym clothes now smell fresh, and dare I say, NEW! I'm very pleased! The scent after washing is even lighter than in the bottle, and to me, it smells fresh.Another thing I noticed is that there seemed to be less lint in the lint trap, which is definitely a good thing.My only complaint (and it's minor) is that the fill lines inside the cap are a bit difficult to see.

Fabric Care,Dreft,Laundry,"Dreft Stage 2: Active Baby Liquid Laundry Detergent (HE), 50 Fl Oz (32 Load",US,"Great detergent, sometimes I sneak my stuff in with the baby laundry!","I'm a fan of Dreft. I used the newborn one up until my son started eating solid foods and staining everything - mostly his bibs. I love the faint, pleasant smell that Dreft has. It's calming in the way that lavender is calming and sometimes I use it on my own clothes for that reason. I even use Dreft for all of my animal bedding (3 chinchillas, one bunny and a pup) because it is so gentle and lightly fragranced. It does a good job of getting the stains out but stubborn ones need a bit more persuasion. For that I usually use a stain remover or do a pre-soak. Tip: You can rinse the bibs after they are used in either cold or warm water and remove the immediate food stains. Put them in a plastic bag - they might smell but Dreft will get it out. Take the bibs out when you are ready to do the laundry and throw them in. Once the hardened stains have been softened and the super duper crud has had a chance to soak - sit back and let Dreft do the rest. Not even Tide Active or bleach has been able to get the stains out without me soaking them first so I'm not going to blame that on Dreft. All in all, I'd say it gets the job done and I wouldn't be hesitant to recommend it!",5.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,Swiffer Sweep and Vac Floor Vaccum Starter Kit,US,Not for litter vacuuming,"I am giving this product a 1-star as it did not meet my expectations for performance. Perhaps, my expectations were too high, but I don't feel they were out of line. I purchased this to quickly vacuum up the minute amount of litter that is tracked outside of our Out-of-Sight Litter Box; which does a FABULOUS job of cutting down on litter tracking. We let it charge overnight and were quite disappointed when all it did was push the litter around like the non-vacuum equipped Swiffer. See the attached photo which is 8 days of litter accumulation on the hardwood floor; with a pen next to it for size reference. We just moved into a new house, 9 days ago and have been pre-occupied, which is why there is 8 days worth litter to clean up. As litter was the primary purpose of our purchase of the product, I can't comment on its performance otherwise as we returned it immediately to our local grocery store. If you were thinking of this product to swiftly take care of any amount of litter, then you should look elsewhere. We have ordered the Electrolux Ergorapido instead to see how it will fare with the litter.

I also preferred powder or some liquid detergent because I like to have a clean smell on my clothes and I want to wash a load once. I have 3 kids, 2 dogs and a cat. As you can imagine, we do a lot of laundry. I am huge subscribe and save fan and the only reason I tried these were because of I didn't have to go to the store and frankly the price was comparable after my 15% off. I use 2 pods per wash, I put them on opposite sides, and I have big loads of laundry, because colors and whites are all I I've time for. I have NEVER had an issue - using cold or hot water, with these staining- except one time, I had put my washer on manual small wash when it was a large wash. So there wasn't much water on the top, some clothes with were still drying. Typically my washing machine auto fills, and I've never had any issues. I love the smell, my colors are bright, the clothes are soft and it's so easy my 6 and 5 year old do their own laundry!! I love this product. If you are a busy mom, I work full time and time is everything to me, this is the way to go! Our clothes have never been cleaner. In fact I don't use stain remover anymore!! The packaging doesn't take up a lot of space either and there is no mess. Love love love this product.",5.0

I tried a different detergent then what I grew up on and really liked it so I thought I should give another well-established softener a shot. WOW!!! I'm impressed. First off the smell is amazing and lasts. I love sniffing my clothes throughout the day. I don't use dryer sheets so the softness and scent of the in wash softener carries over. In reading the bottle it actually says it helps with wrinkles. I didn't know that was a thing with softener. I thought it's sole purpose was to simply make your clothing soft. Well it sure does help with wrinkles. I always shake my clothes between washer and dryer to eliminate wrinkles but sadly my husband does not. Well turns out I don't need to either anymore!

The first two loads came out fine, and I liked the fact that the aromas were dissipated in the warm heat setting of the commercial dryer. I'm not certain about cost -- with three pods, these seem a bit more expensive than using Tide out of a bottle. I'll try two pods next time -- then the price is about the same and convenience favors the pods. I'll amend my review in due course -- about two weeks if history is my guide. :) Robert C.

Doesn't mean it is dirty...right? One day, I ran out detergent and had to go to the local drugstore to buy detergent. There is no natural detergent sold there, so I bought the TIDE, intending to use it only until my order of the green detergent arrive. I wash with Tide, and NO STAINS!!!!

It is an excellent product that seems to be much more concentrated than other brands and has a quite strong (but in a good way) scent to it. The times I have chosen NOT to buy it was usually because it was priced higher than most other brands, including ones you can find at the dollar store. This new packaging that Downey uses results in a much less expensive product that is the same great quality, but without the inflated price tag. I guess that it is debatable whether it is more environmentally sound to sell the product in a disposable container that uses up a very minimal amount of landfill space as opposed to selling it in a recyclable container. If you take into account the fact that not all plastic containers get recycled though, I would say that these new containers are probably the ""greener"" way to go though. The new packaging is really a win-win situation so far as I am concerned. I am getting a better product than I would normally buy for less money than I would usually spend. Having it delivered to my door instead of having to go out shopping for it is just another bonus.",5.0

Home Care,Cascade,Auto Dishwashing,"Cascade Complete ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent, Fresh Scent, 78 Count",US,Keeps your dishwasher's filter clean!,"For the last decade or so, all modern dishwashers have had a removable/cleanable metal screen at the bottom. For years, I would go through the painstaking process of removing this and other associated parts every 4 to 6 months, and cleaning off the sludge that always accumulated and clogged it up. When shopping for a new dishwasher, I described this problem and asked the sales person to show us models without this screens. To which he replied ""they all have them now, it is a code required feature, however it sounds to me like you're simply using too much dishwashing soap. The liquid stuff does not dissolve very well, and if you squirt a bunch in and fill up the cup, it causes that build up that's very hard to remove."" He recommended the dishwasher packs (which I always thought were a more expensive gimmick). I've been using these in a new dishwasher since 2015 and I haven't had to clean anything out yet! I haven't seen any change in performance of the cleaning power either. I recommend.",5.0

Someone had left it an office when they moved out. A month later their office still smelled like vanilla. I put in my office and it lasted like two more weeks. Sadly, it looks like Febreze has discontinued the vanilla scent. I tried the linen one and it's okay. It doesn't seem to fill the room like the vanilla and if I open it all the way up, its a bit overwhelming. Fully open it lasted a little over two weeks. The linen one for the car is the same. Almost nothing when I get in the car, but when I turn on the vents it gets SUPER strong. So bottom line, it seems to vary from scent to scent.",3.0

My son wears converse almost daily and almost instantly the toes are stained just from regular wear. A quick swipe with a magic eraser makes them look like new again... These are also good for baseboards, walls, cook tops... Generally if I'm having an issue with a stain, I'll reach for one of these.

The instructions indicate that you should put the cap into the washing machine but I don't want to put a sharp edged cap in amongst my delicates, especially in modern machines that use less water and make more friction during cleaning. Also, the bottom opening needs to be pressed really hard to shut it or this will leak out and make a nice gooey blue mess.

The main reason I do like them is that they wash clothes, and they wash well removing most stains without stripping the precious colours from my family's clothes which for me is the important reason I continue to purchase this brand of clothes washing detergent. I have always loved Ariel and my mother before me always bought Ariel as they certainly know how to create a product which washes and cares for the clothes. The main reason I purchase the washing capsules in the colour format is that they work quicker at a lower temperature which is what I always wash my coloured and more delicate clothes. I find even with my darker colour clothes that they stay darker longer even after repeated washing. I would like to state I always use a softener which this washing detergent needs and I find the clothes softer which makes our clothes feel and look so much better. Ariel 3 in 1 Colour Washing Capsules are a great way of keeping your clothes clean while holding on to the precious colour which lengthens their longevity, which I find very useful for my more classic and more expensive purchases. But for me, I simply like to keep my own clothes and family’s clothes looking and feeling at their best. Happy to recommend.",5.0

I used 2 tabs on a standard wash in a hard water area and the result was not quite up to the usual powder I use. Whites still retained a few minor stains. The addition of something like Vanish would probably solve this. Having to use 2 tabs per wash makes them quite expensive.

The concept behind the booster beads is simple. Simply poor half a cupful of the beads on top of your clothes before putting them on to wash. The beads fully dissolve in a wash making your clothes smell that much nicer afterwards. The scent from these beads is a fresh and clean one. It’s noticeable as soon as you take the clothes out of your washing machine and remains on your clothes until they go back into the washing machine after wearing them. Indeed, it seems to stay with the clothes for far longer than a standard fabric conditioner would. My wife has been using these beads when washing our clothes for quite a while now and swears by them. I have to agree, they really do work wonders and we’ll definitely continue to buy them. The scent isn’t overpowering but is nevertheless there and noticeable. We’ve found it’s especially good for bed linen too. Highly recommended.",5.0

My wife found them interesting rather than essential, and she will probably just use them occasionally when washing items for storing at the the end of a season, or for a holiday laundry wash. There are currently a choice of five different aromas in this Lenor range available from Amazon with prices ranging from eighteen pounds up to twenty-six depending on your taste.

Measuring into the cap is easy - just fit the cap over the hole and squeeze the container until the gel goes up to the top of the little window. Then remove the cap - keeping it level - and toss into the washing machine. Clothes come up clean, even at lower temperatures, although I did still need to use stain remover on really stubborn stains. This is very scented and the smell lingered on dry washing - which is fine if you like the scent! Fortunately I did, its a slightly fruity smell and if they produced a sharper scented (fresh cotton) variety I'd be hooked.",4.0

Fabric Care,Daz,Laundry Powder,Daz Washing Powder 650g 10 Washes,UK,Great product,I received Daz for colours and whites in order to test the product. I had not used Daz or powder for years favouring gels and liquids to wash my clothes simply because I got fed up cleaning the washing machine drawer after powder had not dissolved properly. This did not happen with Daz. The powder had a pleasant scent and the directions for use were clear. I have marked it down as there is no measure included in the box to measure and pour into the machine drawer therefore I had to use an old measuring jug. When washing my clothes both whites and colours the results were very good and the scent fresh and clean. I washed my clothes at 40 and 30 degrees with Daz and can say the results were excellent at both temperatures. I will definitely buy more but may try the liquid form as it is what I am used to and less bulky to store,4.0

They seem to have a greater ability to clean clothes than the supermarket own-brand we have been using. Colours and whites seem to come out of the machine with no noticeable fading or greying. Prior to these we had a problem with wool items not smelling too nice, using these the whole load has a pleasant fragrance. These have a more 'detergent-y' smell to them, something I prefer over more floral or fruity aromas. The pods make it easy to not use too much detergent, each one being suitable for one full load. If your machine has a smaller capacity, you may find you go through detergent at a faster rate, than if you measured liquid or powder yourself. If you have a machine with a smaller capacity or if the degree of soiling of your loads varies, I'd still recommend trying these and making your own cost comparison. I'll be sticking with them, particularly at the price offered here. When you've finished with the pods, the tubs come in handy for storage.",5.0

Home Care,Fairy,Dish Care Automatic,"Fairy Original All In One Dishwasher Tablets Lemon, 5 x Pack of 25",UK,Happy to use these. But happy to use others too!,"To be honest, i have no loyalty to any particular type or brand of dishwasher tablet, though always buy established brands that I know to be reliable, such as Fairy, Finish et al: frankly, I look for what's on offer. I'm also lucky that I live in a soft water area on the edge of North Yorkshire and have never needed to buy salt or rinsing agents for my machine. So maybe I'm not the toughest customer to please, and I confess, too, to being a little cynical about the marketing of endless variants of tablet: I sometimes think that that has more to do with keeping the brand before the public rather than real advances. At least that's my experience, but, as I say, my circumstances as far as water softness may make things so much easier. These work no better or worse for me than other premium tablets, so as far as I'm concerned I shall continue with my policy of buying what is on offer from the major brands. If there were only pennies in kit I would lean towards Finish Max, but these are fine too and their base price is significantly cheaper.",4.0

Cleans well, with a lighter fragrance than Ariel. White shirts spotless, including collars, at 40C, but I didnt notice any miraculous re-whitening of my towels. Tried on colours and they came out fine too. Lasts for ages and can easily adjust amount according to load size. Everything dissolves even on a 20 minute wash, though I do often feel the need to add an extra rinse. And a cardboard box means one less bit of plastic, even if whats in the box is not exactly green!",4.0
Fabric Care,Lenor,Fabric Conditioner,Lenor Unstoppables Beads Fresh In-Wash Scent Booster - 275 g,UK,An easy way to freshen up your clothes,"These beads without doubt give a lovely aroma to anything you wash in the washing machine, you just need to decide the intensity of the aroma you want by varying the amount of beads you add before you start the wash. It's a bit of a luxury item but once you start using the beads you definitely miss them once they've run out! I'm now very used to loading the beads and getting that lush aroma after a wash cycle and I now use this regularly. The scent obviously wears off after a while and there's no way it will last anywhere near the 12 weeks advertised, though in fairness this figure is for clothes that are left in storage.

A 10 minute soak with a squirt of Fairy Platinum in really hot water and all the burnt stuff just falls off and wipes away. It's also great on cooker tops and any greasy places in the kitchen like cupboard tops and extractor fans.

Happily, the vanilla blossom of this range actually has a nice fresh and pretty scent.

I don't know what P&G have done but using a newly purchased bottle and using it my duvet cover and pillowcases smelt worse after washing! I sniffed the bottle and it smelt acrid/sour. I checked the bottle I'd just finished and that smelt lush. It wasn't my machine causing it because I'd recently cleaned it and the powder/fabric conditioner drawer. I've contacted P&G about it and also had a refund from asda and recently re-ordered Gold Orchid again and it still smelled acrid so went straight back with the delivery driver.

I tend to do most of my washing at 40 degrees and I can confirm that the bags do fully dissolve and they do seem to do a good job at cleaning, albeit I haven't had to remove any difficult stains so far, so haven't any real experience from this perspective.

I must admit I was surprised to discover the Originals' aren't quite as good at cleaning and leaving streak-free glassware than the Platinums - so when the price is comparable I'd chose the Platinums every time. I prefer both to the Finish equivalents. What did annoy me was that these come in lots of small packages. There could be times when you want to take a smaller number with you - maybe staying a couple of weeks in a self-catering accommodation or whatever - but if you're buying in bulk like this the zip lock back option is much easier and less wasteful than having a 5x25 in a box.

I couldn't be bothered to go through the process of getting a refund for £5 so I just ordered another one.

Home Care,Fairy,DISH CARE,Fairy Anti Bacterial Lime Washing Up Liquid 10x383ml,UK,Jack of all trades,I think that sometimes requiring a product to perform several functions means that the effectiveness of another may not be as good as it could be. I think the antibacterial side is a very useful function but it seemed to come at the expense of grease cutting action and it required a lot more elbow grease to clean! It is not as long lasting as their other ones too and I have had to use a lot of it so far to wash up a few plates so it will not last long in my household. Therefore it is not good value for money for me I found. My primary need is for effective cleaning and long lasting contents so will give this one a miss next time.,3.0

I've never liked washing powder as its so bulky to store, and I'm also not a fan of big bottles of washing liquid because it's messy and also hard to store. So the washing capsules are my ideal solution as there is no mess, no fuss and they are compact and easier to store. I literally just grab one out of the cupboard, pop it in the drum with the clothes and set the machine running. We have a water softener which also assists with washing as less detergent is required with soft water, so I only need to use one capsule for an average load of around 6-7kgs dry weight. I also use the quick wash option on my machine as we generally don't need an intensive wash. These particular tablets are for dark fabrics which need to be washed without bleach or optical brighteners. They keep the darker fabrics nice and dark and don't make everything grey. 5 stars.",5.0

I even contacted the company. I was told they did not change anything from the person I dealt with.

We've used Fairy or Finish products for years, and in a moderately hard water area, have not experienced any problems with limescale. The manufacturers, Proctor and Gamble, list these as having 10 'incredible' cleaning functions - and though I'm not convinced about the validity of 'no need to unwrap' being identified as one of these, grease dissolvers, stain removal, silver protection, limescale prevention and 'super shine' are all more clearly relevant.

I don't normally use scented laundry products, and I don't think this changes my mind. I started with about 1/4 cap in the laundry drum, and I could barely smell anything after the wash cycle and absolutely nothing after the dry cycle. I gradually moved up to 3/4 cap, and while it's a bit strong in the wash, I find it just noticeable when I'm folding my clean and dry laundry. It's great if that's what you're looking for! I'm just not sold on this particular scent, or maybe just the concept. I do feel it's a waste to use so much just to get a trace of a scent, and I'm not sure how I feel about adding random additives to my laundry just to get it to smell a certain way.[This review was collected as part of a promotion]",5.0

We've been using Finish brand exclusively in our Whirlpool Gold and Bosch dishwashers for the last 7 years. After using up this box of Cascade Complete, we are both impressed. To give these a good test, I left dishes in the dishwasher without rinsing them for 24 hours. When I opened up the dishwasher to put in the tab, an intense wall of decay blasted me in the face when I opened up the door, it knocked me back a few feet. I thought maybe an animal had crawled in there and died. Sufficiently soiled, we ran it on normal cycle - and to my relief, it came out perfectly clean and the putrid smell had been washed away as well. From now on, we will be buying either Finish or Cascade when we run out - whichever brand is on sale is what we will purchase. No white spots, no water spots, no food leftovers, and super easy to toss in the dishwasher...no opening foil packs.",5.0

The scent is refreshing and the washed clothes are noticeably less stubborn. Tide PODS are super easy to use, all you have to do is pop one, or two, or three into your washing machine, depending on the load size and you are set. These easily dissolve in both hot and cold water wash. But one tip that I would like to still share with users of any type of detergent ""pods"", is to put the pod into the washing machine first, before you add your dirty laundry, as this will ensure that the pod dissolves during the wash (I did not know this and I would sometimes end up with undissolved pods). Overall, although these PODS cost a little more, they do bring more convenience and make doing laundry a tiny bit more enjoyable. I would definitely recommend these!",5.0

Tbh I didn't notice that it made sports gear any better-smelling, but it did work to clean the clothes as well as the 'regular' Tide Pods I use do. There is more of a scent to these pods vis-a-vis the regular pods. The re-sealable package, while a bit difficult and cumbersome to figure out at first, keeps the pods fresh by locking out moisture (and curious children). The edges of the package are sharp and I'm afraid I'll cut myself if not careful. But the packaging is sturdy - and it needs to be. You are meant to use more than one pod for larger loads. I did this, however, and found a ""Tide Pod booger"" on one of my pairs of yoga pants - part of the blue bit hadn't completely dissolved for some reason. It only happened once but it was kind of off-putting. Overall, this is a good product which works well to clean and freshen your laundry.",4.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer Dusters 360 Extendable Handle Starter Kit, 4-Count",CA,Extendable version of the handheld Swiffer duster - perfect for ceiling corners and fan blades!,"Swiffer dusters have made household upkeep a lot simpler since I first started using them. This extendable version of the Swiffer duster is excellent for reaching hard to reach areas like the tops of fan blades, cabinets and other areas which are prone to collecting dust. I love how easy it is to extend the length of the duster and adjust the angle. I think it may be ideal to purchase this version as opposed to the traditional handheld version as this one is more versatile. I just love that I can reach the spiderwebby corners of my room with this duster and that I can also dust the surface of my fan blades without stepping onto a chair or step stool. If you're also a fan of the regular handheld Swiffer duster then this is a no-brainer.",5.0
Fabric Care,Gain,FABRIC ENHANCER,Gain Fireworks In-Wash Scent Booster Beads,CA,New Favourite Laundry Product,I had been wanting to try Gain Fireworks In-Wash Original Scent Booster for a long time now but sometimes I am skeptical of parting with hard earned money on something I have never tried before. About 5 minutes after the bottle showed up in the mail we put a load of laundry in and we were hooked. We already loved the scent of Gain products and now our clothes smell stronger and longer then ever before. This product is great for people that have a lot of clothes or towels that won't necessary be used right away but you still want them to smell freshly washed even a week later. We have already bought a second bottle in a different scent and I can't see us ever not using them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion],4.0

Shown as a 32 pc tub insted what I got was a ziplock bag with 15 pcs. So the must have shrunk in transit!!! Furthermore the so called childproof zip on the package is not just childproof it is also adult proof for those who have arthritis in their hands (my wife does) or other hand problems. Very difficult to open, but hey a scissors worked well! As for the actual little pods, which look like jello and no wonder kids would want to eat it, are actually convenient to carry to the laundry room (as not all people live in houses) but our whites were not as clean as before when we used another brand, when we used 2 pods. In our next load we had to use 3 of them, for the same load size to get the same cleanliness that we were used to by the other brand. Therefore, we can only rate this detergent only as 3 stars, and that is being generous. I've checked the pricing against our usual brand, this Tide product was about 25% more expensive, and we had to use more! Thus we will not buy this product!",3.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer Wetjet Original Pad Refills, 24 Count Pack (Pack of 2)",CA,One Pad Cleans My Entire House's Hardwood/Tiled Areas,"These pads are every bit as good as the pads they're replacing. I really like how easy they are to apply to the Swiffer WetJet Mop. I put one pad on the floor (purple-line side facing down) and push the WetJet down on top of it, like a ridiculously oversized stamp. It's an easy way to make sure everything lines up, rather than trying to apply the pad to the WetJet by hand. When you're done cleaning, just pull it off and throw it away, exactly like you would a Band-Aid. In terms of cleaning, the pads do a great job of dealing with stains and picking up dirt. They're pretty absorbent too, so are good for cleaning up minor spills (not heavy-duty stuff). The pads make sure my hardwood floors look shiny and dry quickly, meaning they're perfect for a quick clean-up before any guests arrive. One thing I noticed is that if your pad isn't clean (i.e. you've already used it to clean your kitchen or something), it will start pushing dirt away, like a broom, rather than picking it up. If you find yourself in that situation, my advice is to just stick on a new pad. Otherwise, you'll spend the next few minutes trying to clean all the dirt you managed to push into a corner. Considering that I am able to clean my entire house's hardwood and tiled areas with just one pad, I think the price is pretty reasonable for the 24-count Wood version. If there were some sort of Subscribe & Save option, they'd be even cheaper. TL;DR The pads are easy to apply, quite absorbent, and clean up stains/dirt in a jiffy.",5.0

I've been using Magic Erasers since they first came out many years ago. (I remember getting a free sample in the mail or something and originally didn't know what to do with it. Lol.) But I love these things, mainly for making my kitchen sink look spotless. They're also great for getting stains off walls and other solid surfaces. My only beef was that they didn't last that long. (But they're cheap, so meh.) However these say that they're ""extra durable"", which now makes these perfect. If you've never used these before, don't hesitate to try them out. If you have, then you're likely already sold and don't need to even read these reviews to order more. Lol. (I'll try to remember to come back here and post what these look like after a few weeks of use. They start to get greyer looking (from the stainless steel in my sink I think) and they just become less thick until they're very thin and almost disintegrate.)",5.0

To activate it you use run it under water, give it a couple of squeezes, and start scrubbing. I used these to tidy up the kitchen and the bathroom, and I am so please with how well they worked. They cleaned everything away like magic! Of course, like regular Magic Erasers, you need to follow behind with a damp cloth to clean up any residue. These erasers seem to last longer than the regular ones. Perhaps because the sponge middle holds them together a little better. There isn't a lot of Dawn detergent in them, so you aren't going to end up with huge smears of soap across your microwave or walls. The Dawn does lend nice scent to these too. Do note that there are lots of surfaces you shouldn't use these on, like painted, polished, high gloss, copper, stainless steel, or vehicle bodies.

I wouldn't normally get anything scented but lately I've been separating my clothing into two batches: regular ""office and town clothes"" - shirts, socks, pants etc - and ""performance athletic"" gear - underwear, tights, shirts and so on. After a very unpleasant experience with eye-wateringly strong scented detergent (I'm looking at you, ""Persil""), I'm a bit of a skeptic about scented detergents but this Tide Pod variety has been great, especially with the athletic gear. With a ""normal"" sized load in an HE washer, dropping two pods in the drum resulted in very mildly scented clothes that came out very clean. They retain just a hint of fragrance out of the washer (and dryer) and don't cause skin irritation.

I love it because it is good if you want to avoid having to bend down to sweep up floor debris (dust, hair and other little particles) all the time or hate the inconvenience of carrying around a corded vacuum stick or even having to use electricity. I love this product because I am able to get at hard-to-reach areas of the apartment that I couldn't get at with the stick vac, and this product doing a really good job. Based on other reviews that said the product is throwing debris back out, this can even happen with a stick vac. It is important to empty the debris out of the tiny canister when it starts to fill up, otherwise the debris could possibly shoot out and not collect anything anymore. It's easy to see if it's full because it's transparent. Also, it has to move forward and not backwards to pick up the debris.

Home Care,Mr Clean,Surface Care,"Mr. Clean Magic Eraser Kitchen Scrubber, 2 Count- Packaging May Vary",CA,Works great with some effort.,"We usually remove stubborn stains by wetting it with water and using some dishwashing detergent to scrub it off. This usually does the trick after a few tries depending on the type of stain. I used the Magic Eraser Kitchen scrubber from Mr. Clean on a variety of situations and here is what I found. This Magic eraser does not have a rough surface for scrubbing. Instead, it has 2 soft sides and it solely relies on the chemicals it contains. On hard burnt stains on bottom of pants and on the stove top, the magic eraser worked wonders but with a little effort. I still had to rely on water to soak the stain and then the Magic eraser did the rest. I did not have to add detergent as the water activated the chemical in the scrubber and it became foamy. After a few wipes from the scrubber the stain disappeared. I used the scrubber on my quartz counter top and it really cleaned up some stains. I used the scrubber with some water and wiped the countertops and then wiped clean with a damp cloth. Since the scrubber is made of soft sponge material, I am not expecting it to last for a long time especially with hard stains.",4.0

I have tried less expensive brands but it comes out of the bottle looking like blue colored water. Downy makes my clothes soft and wrinkle free and smelling nice. It makes everything static free and makes the clothing fibers last longer. A little bit seems to go a long way, so even though Downy may cost more, the bottle lasts a long time. I usually choose the Clean Breeze scent because the name itself is so refreshing. I recently tried April Fresh for the first time and I am quite impressed with the scent from the moment I opened the bottle to the clothes I am wearing now that I washed yesterday.

Too much emphasis on ""plant based"" ingredients shows it's just a gimmick.","This is an ""okay"" laundry detergent. It does a decent job and made my clothes clean. So, I am happy. The best part is the great scent of this detergent that I can smell as I pour it into the machine. However, the product description says this is ""Gain's first entry into the 'natural' laundry detergent category."" Which is why I notice a clear attempt to show that ""natural"" concept in the labeling, which overdoes the ""plant-based"" ingredient listing in the label. Of course, it is only 65% plant based, so the over emphasis on ""plant based"" comes off as simply an advertising ploy. This is a decent laundry detergent and has no phosphates and dyes, but it is expensive at $12 for 2.2 liters. I will stick to my $15 for 4 liters laundry detergent from the supermarket.",3.0

Pressing the tip down dispensing some detergent, and then you rub on your clothing with that same tip until the stain is no longer visible. The smell isn't great, but it is fairly subtle, and far better than having a ruined piece of clothing! I also love the shape and size of the pen, it is thin and easy to throw in any bag. The price for this three pack is also better than I've seen at Walmart and other retailers. I was traveling with my mum once and we were having chilli at the airport for dinner before our flight. She spilled chilli on her beige pants, and hadn't brought a second pair of pants - she was so upset!

I enjoy the smell as they have a strong smell but not an overpowering one. The scent is relatively universal for clean laundry and does not have a perfume-like scent. The amount that came in this package was good, but I base that decision on the per pod cost. If a smaller quantity option is on sale, I would purchase that over this size. The only advice that I would give if you are new to using laundry pods over traditional detergent, is you likely want to put the laundry in for a slightly longer cycle so that the pod completely dissolves in the laundry.",5.0

The colours are bright, and not too overwhelming. Its very easy to read the scent, as well as see that its a plant based detergent. You can easily see the warning labels (harmful if swallowed etc), weight, and that its for both top loading, and front loading washing machines. The directions on the back of the bottle are easy to read, as it comes with pictures as well. It is a bit difficult to read the ingredients of the detergent as the font is small. My favorite part is that the bottle is clear so you can see how much detergent is left. All detergents should come in a clear(ish) bottle. One over-the-top aspect is the ingredient list. Almost everything in it has ""Plant based XXX"" ""Plant Derived YYY"" ""Plant Based ZZZ"" That statement could be made to Oxygen, which is generated by plants. Its definitely a bit of a gimmicky ploy. Product The smell of this detergent is really nice. Its not overpowering, but not underpowering either. I used this on my newborn's clothes, which had both poop and spit-up staining on it. The stains came out pretty good (I had also put dish soap on the stains before washing). The detergent has a nice consistency to it, and poured into the measuring lid no problem. Price The price of this was a little more I thought it would be, but wasn't super off. The bottle is a bit smaller than expected for the price, and the container wasn't completely filled to where I felt it should have been for the price.

No more excuses for missing the ceiling corners either due to the extended range. It still doesn't let me (at 5'-2"") reach the high areas without a chair, but definitely gives me a boost.

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,"Tide Pods + Febreze Sport Odor Defense Laundry Pacs, Active Fresh Scent, Regular & He Washers, 15 Count",CA,"Cleans well, very strongly scented","In my experience, Tide consistently provides the best results (compared to other brands) especially when it comes to laundering heavily soiled clothes, linens, etc. I have always trusted it to 'get the job done' when it comes to things like my husband's work clothes or the dog's blanket, so trying this was a no brainer for me. I have never used laundry 'pods' before, so I was also curious to see what the fuss was about. As far as performance goes, I did not notice any difference between the pods and my liquid Tide detergent. I used one pod for what I would consider an average (medium sized) load, and my clothes came out clean. I feel I must point out that I was washing 'regular' laundry- not anything too heavily soiled or smelly. It wasn't unexpected, given that these pods have '+ Febreze Sport Odor Defense' and are clearly geared for stinky, sweat saturated, clothes, but I did find my clothes were quite heavily scented- definitely more so than usual. If strong perfumes aren't your thing then you will probably want to avoid these all together. However, when it comes to say...sports uniforms, workout clothes or just musty or heavily soiled items, I think these would definitely be the way to go for fresher smelling laundry...... The bottom line for me: these provide the dependable results I have come to expect from Tide, however, the stronger scent (which I don't really care for, if I am being honest) is unnecessary, and in my case unwanted, for my usual laundering needs , so I will be reserving these for heavy duty laundering only. As for the pods vs. regular liquid detergent? I will stick with my liquid Tide. There is nothing wrong with the pods, don't get me wrong, but I see absolutely no advantage to using them so for me they are just a gimmick. I am perfectly capable/content to measure exactly as much, or as little, detergent as I want to use. It's not a big deal.",4.0

You have the option of using it undiluted for extra cleaning power or mix it into a bucket of water (or spray bottle) to clean surfaces or even floors. It's not super liquidy, it has more of a consistency like dish soap, thicker and more manageable so it squirts out in controllable amounts instead of just pouring out. The lemony scent is a classic which I find leaves an enjoyably fresh citrusy scent. I've used it for cleaning counters, cleaning messes in my fridge and for washing my floors.

Home Care,Mr Clean,Surface Care,"Mr. Clean Magic Eraser Kitchen Scrubber, 2 Count- Packaging May Vary",CA,Amazing. Best magic erasers there are.,"I used to love Regular Magic Erasers but now they just seem inadequate compared to these. These are amazing. I used them at my father-in-law's house to take out decade-old stains out of the counter that he thought were part of the counter. I cleaned a very run-down house with a bunch of them and it looks almost like it's had a paint job and the cupboards and the kitchen and the bathrooms and all of the walls and everything look clean for the first time in over 10 years. You can't get marks like that out with anything else. And they last way longer than the standard ones do and even the extra strength magic erasers. There's another upgraded version of magic erasers that I tried that are all right but these of all of the magic erasers are by far the best. I can't say enough about them-I talk about them to everybody. They are an OCD girls dream...lol. Just a word to the wise, these are not meant to pick up dirt or grime-they're meant to remove it. So if you use these, always wipe up immediately behind it with a paper towel and it makes them much more efficient. Otherwise you're loosening everything that you never would have normally been able to loosen but you're not actually really removing it. You just remove it the next time you wipe it.",5.0

They work as good if not better than the liquid detergent, and these ones also smell very refreshing and almost a little bit of mango or papaya to me. The scent lasts all day too, doesn't dissipate after an hour of wear. Ive noticed that after using them, a one of my favorite shirts that was previously stained from a deodarant has cleaned up and is essentially a stain free shirt now.The OXI clean does help and I have been using the spray bottles on tough stains for years, usually grass or tomato sauce stains on lighter clothing. In all honesty, they are just an easier to use version of a liquid laundry detergent at a somewhat premium price for this convenience. Well worth it.",5.0

As more and more people are buying more and more cleaning supplies for different unique uses, you home can turn quick to clutter. This is specifically why my wife and I loved this!

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,TIDE LIQUID PODS FRESH CORAL BLAST  4/31 COUNT,CA,super simple,"Tide pod melting away As an average Joe that has not stayed up to date with the newest Laundry Tech, this was my first time using Tide Pods ( let alone any pod). I had always stuck to my large container of Tide or Gain ( depending what was on sale). I have used both HE Machines and Regular Machines. I do like how simple the Pods are to use Effectiveness: I found the pod did its job, one pod per Medium size load. I was not a tv commercial worthy clean nor did I realize it was 10x more effective. It cleaned my clothes and it cleaned them well. (5/5) Ease of Use: Simple. Drop the pod in the washing machine. Can't be easier (5/5) Smell: If you have used time more than once you obviously didn't mind the smell. This smells like tide but stronger, with more of a fruity/fresh smell….. think Gain…. I like it. If your sensitive to fragrances, this might not be for you. It's not overly strong but you can certainly smell it on your clothes. (5/5) Like: 1. It is so simple your significant other who has never done laundry could do it. 2. Fresh Smell 3. Tamper Proof Packaging Dislike: 1. Looks Like Candy 2. I'm constantly scared I'm going to pop a pod in my hand. Don't know how much pressure they can handle. 3. Generally higher cost than liquid Summary: They work well for their job, keeping laundry simple. No measuring or pouring, making it easy to delegate laundry duty. The smell is very nice and refreshing, and the package has child lock proofing on it making it harder for a very young child to open the item. If you are looking to simplify your laundry life, train your kids/spouse to do laundry don't want to carry your large detergent jug to a shared laundry facility. This is for you. On a side note: Sadly more adults have passed in the US from eating consuming laundry pods than kids. I'm not sure if this trend carries to Canada. But best to tell everyone in the house that they are laundry pods. * Video is at 20 times speed. With spinning action the pod fully dissolves.",5.0

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,DOWNY 40 L AF,CA,Love this stuff,"I didn’t used to be a fabric softener user. Once I spend a whole day running loads of laundry with fabric softener, I can honestly say I’ll probably never go back. With small children I do laundry every day. Sometimes clothes come out dry and stiff and the color fades fast sometimes sometimes my clothes were dry and staff or the color faded too fast. I have now found that with using downy fabric softener, my clothes are not only softer when I take them out, but the color is fading a lot less. I also enjoy the fresh scent The fabric softener leaves behind on my clothes. When I washed my sheets for my bed, it was so wonderful laying down and having them smell so fresh. I will never go back to not using fabric softener again. This is a life-changing move [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0

Of course, there are still some chemicals in this product, they have not managed to go completely free, but I like the end result.

Home Care,Cascade,Auto Dishwashing,"Cascade Platinum ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent, Fresh Scent, 16 count",CA,Best dish washing pods,"I dislike having to pre-rinse or scrub dishes before they are put into the dishwasher; after all that is why we have a dishwasher in the first place. We live on an acreage and depend on well water which tends to be on the hard side and therefore we require a very good dishwashing detergent. We have used the Cascade products for years and find they we get the best results with them especially the Platinum label. The mixture of powder and liquid pods seems to do a better job than solid dishwashing pucks. The Cascade Platinum detergent does not leave white spots from mineral deposits or residues on the glassware and silverware. Dishwasher also looks very clean after a cycle is finished. I prefer however to buy the Cascade pods in larger quantity packages since it does cut down on the cost. This particular package was labeled “Fresh Scent” and does not have an overpowering smell which is important to us since both myself and husband can’t tolerate strong fragrances. Highly recommended.

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,"Tide PODS Plus Downy HE Turbo Laundry Detergent Pacs, April Fresh, 43 count",CA,cleans well w/one pod per average load; very convenient but pricier than liquid detergent,"Laundry detergent ""pods"" are quite convenient; no messy drips onto your floor as you're pouring detergent or fabric softener. Even better with these ones is both detergent and softener are combined. I'm usually a pretty frugal consumer, buying in bulk, couponing, checking sales and so forth. I average a couple of small to medium loads a week and use one of the pods per load so a bag like this would last me three months. I see the recommendation on the bag to use 2 pods for average loads, 3 pods for large - I find that overkill in an HE machine like mine. One pod is enough. If I had extensive dirt or grease (from camping or wrenching my car) I might add another pod to help dissolve the grime. For my usual, ""dirty but not funky"" clothes, they come out clean with one pod. I find the scent left by the softener pleasant but somewhat strong. Not ""eye-wateringly like Axe body spray"" strong but strong enough it seems to last while sitting in a closet. Be aware of this if you're sensitive to fragrances. I will likely continue to use bulk detergent, HOWEVER, there are times when I want the convenience of pods. One use that comes to mind: if I have house guests I don't want messing up the washing machine, I'll tell them to just ""chuck a single pod in the drum of the machine"" - no worries about the machine overflowing with suds. Not quite top marks on account of being pricier than liquid detergent but they do clean very well.",4.0

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,DOWNY 40 L AF,CA,I have been wowed!,"Well I’m 36 years old and always used snuggle on my laundry since I could remember because that’s what my mom used growing up. So naturally when I moved out and started buying my own, I stuck with what I knew worked. I tried a different detergent then what I grew up on and really liked it so I thought I should give another well-established softener a shot. WOW!!! I’m impressed. First off the smell is amazing and lasts. I love sniffing my clothes throughout the day. I don’t use dryer sheets so the softness and scent of the in wash softener carries over. In reading the bottle it actually says it helps with wrinkles. I didn’t know that was a thing with softener. I thought it’s sole purpose was to simply make your clothing soft. Well it sure does help with wrinkles. I always shake my clothes between washer and dryer to eliminate wrinkles but sadly my husband does not. Well turns out I don’t need to either anymore! What a time saver. The clothing comes out just as nice whether I shake it between or not. I’m very impressed with downy. I will for sure be making a permanent switch!!!!

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,"Tide PODS Plus Downy HE Turbo Laundry Detergent Pacs, April Fresh, 61 count",CA,An extremely effective washing combo in a very convienent delivery system. A money saving approach.,"We have been using Tide ""Cold"" powder in our house for YEARS. Then we recently made one of our biggest purchasing mistakes ever in having replaced our old washer and dryer with a pair of useless high efficient crap. Since then, we switched to liquid Tide HE detergent and have been bitterly disappointed with the results in our laundry. We know it is not the Tide because we have also tried other detergents (out of desperation) since and the Tide still provided the best results for us. Enter these Tide pods, what a difference they have made. Don't get me wrong, the machines are still hopeless but these pods have definitely helped. It is without question that these pods, clean very well, provide a very strong and residual scent that lasts for days, literally eliminates the need for a seperate fabric softener and reduce the cost and waste of simply ""pouring in"" detergent or fabric softener on a ""that looks right"" basis. My hat off to any of you that actually measure these things with any regularity. Our clothes have seen whiter results as well as brighter colors, better stain removal and fresher scents after all has been done. The addition of fabric softener in the pods means a space saving in the cupboards as well as the need to perform that function in having to add it seperately. These Tide pods are all about effective cleaning and convienent use and although they cost a little more up front, we firmly believe we are saving money when all is considered in the long run. We enthusiastically recommend this product.",5.0

Having pods that dissolve in any temperature is definitely a game changer. They're super convenient and really easy to use. These pods are pretty great for smelly clothes. I usually sweat a lot when I work out or even when I'm walking outside when it's a hot day and my clothes might reek of BO (body odor). These pods definitely remove that smell from my clothes, but the scent might be a bit too strong. Also, I noticed that this detergent fades color from clothing a bit more than the detergent I normally use. Overall, I really like this detergent, for my whites, I'll definitely be using this. For my colors however, I'll be sticking with my liquid detergent.",4.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer 360 Dusters Heavy Duty Starter Kit, 2 Count",CA,like two back-to-back regular Swiffers - great for delicate and intricate surfaces,"I've been using various Swiffer products for years but this is my first try with the ""360"" version. First of all, I'll continue to use a microfiber cloth for things like kitchen surfaces where I can easily spray them with a cleaner to disinfect. I would take that approach with delicate electronics, or difficult to reach thing like a ceiling fan, which is where a Swiffer comes in handy. Swiffers in general do a great job trapping dust in their ""fluff"" with minimal pressure or repeated passes. I wouldn't trust anything but a fresh Swiffer to clean an HDTV without scratching it. The 360 version differs from the standard Swiffers I'd been using in that it's basically two Swiffers back to back - there's ""fluff"" on both sides of the slots where you insert the handle. A quick shake and you have good coverage on both sides that excels is odd shapes and tight spaces. In my attached photo, the blue version is the standard, and the yellow is the 360 Swiffer. Don't expect quite the ""perfect puffball"" you see in some of the promotional photos - it's still a bit irregular - but there isn't a flat side as with the standard Swiffer. In use, I give these 5-stars. My ONLY complaint is cost: you want to limit your use of these to delicate or intricate surfaces and throw them out once they get clogged up or you risk scratching things like HDTVs. As such, it gets costly to replace these frequently. As such, I'd dropping 1-star.",4.0

I have followed all directions given by Tide, and done research, and the amount of clothes and water doesn't seem to matter. I always put them in the drum beforehand also. What happens in front loader machines, is that as it spins, the little pod can get caught in clothes, sheets, and get twisted up, unable to escape. This is not Tide's fault, but it is a failure of these products in general which dont appear to dissolve as well in less than optimal conditions. I used to use Purex pods prior to this, and didn't seem to have the same issues. Buyer beware, they have ruined a pair of sheets. I didn't check before drying (you shouldn't have to inspect laundry for Tide Pod residue), and now there is outer film and detergent residue fused to part of my sheets.",1.0

My wife does the laundry because I'm kind of inept in that department, but I can definitely take credit for at least the IDEA to use this detergent for our towels and blankets. My wife was a skeptic at first, she uses Tide coldwater in our HE front loading washer. We find that scented detergents irritate our skin. We have a 7 year old daughter as well, so when we had her we gave up on scented detergents. However, this is plant based botanical scents, so it's meant to be gentle and safe for sensitive skin. It smells amazing, the towels and bedding that comes out after a wash in this stuff is heavenly. I love it. The only thing we aren't sure about in the ingredients list is ""fragrance"" ... everything else seems to be natural or botanical ingredients, but ""fragrance"" could be a chemical, I just wish they were a bit more clear about what that is.",5.0

I do like that it has more plant based ingrediants than the regular stuff but its still only 65 percent plant based. Hopefully in the future they will create a 100 percent plant based, of which I will switch entirely to and avoid all other products. The bottle is relatively small though, but should last a month at least with a few loads each weekend. The scent is mild as aforementioned but maybe you like mild scents instead of smelling like recently washed clothes.

The handle length is extendable and the angle of the duster can be angled for regular surfaces or harder to reach areas like fan blades, corners and ceilings.

It’s been three days since I washed my sheets with this product and each night when I go to lay down or even take a nap the scent of the lavender is very soothing it’s not overpowering and it just comfort to me. I am completely loving this product and the fact that it has the fabric protectant technology is great I feel like my clothes will last a little longer and the colors will stay true longer. My granddaughter lives with me and most of her clothes are very vibrantly colored and I’ve had problems with washing them and the color fading when they come out of the washing machine and with this product I did not see that and I washed two of her new outfits!!!

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,SWIFFER WEJET REFILL PADS - EXTRA POWER,CA,Work well,"This is a pretty fair price and comparable to store prices, always nice to see. You require the base Swiffer wetjet to use these, but if you see them on sale you can actually use them to fit onto most types of mops, for example I could use them with my Vileda mop as well. Officially they are intended to be used with the Swiffer wetjet, but sometimes it's better value to buy these, depending on your mop. The good thing about these is they make cleaning very quick and easy and you just toss them afterward, the negative of that being excess waste. However, if you're in a rush and you want a fast and easy mop pad, these do a good job. They are ideal for refilling your Wetjet. I used them on my wood floors with no problems (finished wood) and it left them nice and shiny. These are the dry pads, so make sure you are using them with a mop that sprays (like the wetjet), or you can buy the wet pads if you prefer.",5.0

What's the price?","The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because it's unclear what the pricing of this item is, as it's not being sold by Tide at the moment. I love the idea of these bags, and while I only received one bag for testing and review purposes, the usual format of sale for these bags is in twos and threes. On Amazon.com in the U.S., a pack of three of these bags is less than 20USD, which is obviously a great deal, and then of course there's the added benefit of less waste since there's no need to produce the plastic bottles. If the price is equivalent to this level for sale here in Canada, then I am 100% on board, as Tide has always been my personal favorite laundry detergent. This HE formula is even better if you have a high efficiency machine, as I do, because you need to use only very little detergent per load. I will do my best to keep an eye on this product and update my rating accordingly based on the price once it's set. Since value is a very important variable in terms of what I would personally rate a product, I will give it a provisional 3 stars until I can get an idea of the price.",3.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,Swiffer WetJet Hardwood Floor Spray Mop Starter Kit,CA,Love Swiffer!,"Absolutely love Swiffer products and the WetJet is no different. I hated having to mop the floors. Filling the bucket with water and floor cleaner. Lugging the heavy water-filled mop bucket around the room that I'm mopping. Soak, ring, wash, repeat, empty the bucket and then the mop is dripping water everywhere until it's dry. Not with the Swiffer Wetjet. Just attach the pad using the velcro on the bottom (a little different from the Swiffer Sweeper attachment), press the button to squirt floor cleaner where you want to mop, then mop and then just remove the pad and throw it away. Not only are you not lugging a heavy bucket around and having to empty it but the floor seems to dry a lot quicker as well since you aren't mopping with a soaking wet sponge or rope/string mop. There are so many scent options for the floor cleaning solution as well if you want a little extra freshness. It comes with 1 power floor spray mop, 3 extra power pad refills, 2 original mopping pad refills, 1 bottle (500ML) of cleaning solution, and a nice bonus it comes with batteries! This is my 4th Swiffer product so far. I have the Swiffer WetJet, Swiffer Sweeper, Swiffer 360 Duster with extendable handle and the small handled Swiffer Duster (for the car) and couldn't be happier. It's a great option for many floor types (hardwood, linoleum, tile, etc.). Overall, I'm very happy with this mop and would recommend it to anyone. Especially older people or people with arthritis who can't lift a heavy water-filled mop bucket.",3.0

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,DWNY INF LAV SER 120,CA,Luxuriously soft,"I used this product in a top-loading non-HE washing machine, in the rinse cycle dispenser. First use was on a large load of delicates on cold wash cycle. Packaging - I think the bottle of this fabric softener is lovely and inviting. It looks luxurious and is a pleasure to use. Scent - At first whiff, undiluted, the product is very intense. This was a good sign to me, because I know it will stick around (and smell better) thru the washing and drying. Consistency - The product had an olive oil consistency, a little runnier than my other liquid detergent, and much darker. After the drying cycle, the first thing I picked out of the dryer was an old cotton dress my grandmother made for me that my daughter now wears. I''''ve washed this dress a bunch of times, and there is a definite difference in the softness of the dress (cotton) and the scent was lovely. It''''s a nice soft scent, not overwhelming. I also noticed none of the clothing was as wrinkly as it normally is coming out of the dryer for me. (It had been sitting the the dryer for at least 24 hours prior to removal, too.) I''''m excited to use this on my sheets and towels next, the scent and the softness are so luxurious! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0
Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,DOWNY 40 L AF,CA,Downy Cares!,Downy April Fresh Liquid Fabric Conditioner is definitely one that you need to try.

I was impressed to find out that the fresh scent was still there even after the clothing had sat in the washer overnight after being washed. There is also less fuzz and pills on clothing; less wrinkles after drying. Also I noticed less static when taking the clothing from the dryer. This Downy really protects your clothing. I was truly impressed and glad that I tried this product. I will definitely be buying it again. The small size lasts through 40 loads so that in itself is a bargain.

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,TIDE LIQUID PODS FRESH CORAL BLAST  4/42 COUNT,CA,"Simple, Convinient and Powerful","We have used Tide Original HE Laundry Detergent for years. But we are totally sold for the convenience, simplicity and performance of this product. Since we tried them few years back, we have never looked back. There is no need to lift and carry those heavy liquid laundry detergent containers and no need for measuring cups. Just toss a 3-in-1 pack into the washer to clean brighten and fight stains. Use two pacs for large loads and three pacs for extra-large loads. Of course, the convenience is one part, but PODS also works exceedingly well in terms of cleaning power as long as you put right numbers of pods per load size. PODS are also ideal for travel. This particular pods are 3-in-1 that means it is Detergent + Stain Removal + Color Protector. It provides consistently good cleaning results every wash including large bedding. Stain remover and brightener works well and results on white clothes is satisfactory. We have also tried 4-in-1 version which adds febreeze odor remover as well and can highly recommend that as well if odor is concern. This particular version is specially formulated for HE machines but it can also be used on Non-HE machines. It can be used in both Hot and Cold Waters. It can be used in both front and Top loading machines. Very versatile and convenient! It should be noted that these pods looks so attractive and it should always be kept out of reach of small children. Good news is This package features child guard lock which requires pressing of two tabs on sides of cap to open it. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and high recommend it. I hope this quick summary was helpful. If you liked reading my review, you can give me thumbs up by pressing “helpful” button at the end of this review.",5.0

The scent is too strong for both me and my wife. We ALWAYS wash with an extra rinse(front loading high end machine) and never use fabric softener - we use vinegar instead (long story short, fabric softener is evil) so we were happy to try something labeled as plant based. Even with the extra rinse, the scent clings to it, almost like a film on the clothing.

Whoever thought it was a good idea to have the on and off button (not a switch) right at the curve of the handle obviously had never actually tested the product themselves!! If your hand slips down just a little bit you end up turning the machine off! I must turn this thing on and off about 6+ times during the course cleaning my floors! It's super frustrating! Nevermind the fact that I'm sure it's not great for battery life which everyone seems to have an issue with if you read any of the other reviews!I would still recommend this product but I think the design needs to be revisited. Even if it was a switch that would stay in place even if you touched it instead of a button it would be a huge improvement! I'm sure I'll get frustrated enough to try and fandangle some kind of fix so I stop swearing at it!! lol,3.0

Home Care,Febreze,Air Care,"Febreze Car Air Freshener Hawaiian Aloha, 0.195 Oz, 3 Count",CA,Fragrance is good but does not last that much,"Review for: ""New Car"" fragrance vent clip My car undergoes full detailing twice a year and maintained clean throughout the year and we do not have pet or smoker so there are no odor issues. But I still like to keep mild pleasant scent running. Years ago, I was using AmbiPur scents which I liked a lot and for some reasons I can't find them any longer. I started using Febreeze and I find their most scents little stronger to my taste especially I disliked their linen scent. Since I like to keep my car looking and feeling new, I am always in search of different “New Car” scents. Though scent is quite good, it does not feel like new car scent to me. It feels more floral and vanilla kind of scent. In terms of fragrance strength, it bit strong to my taste, but it is okay at lowest settings. May be this is because, my car has minimum odours. The product picture shows “upto 60 days” but it should be noted that this is for included 2 clips not for each clip. That means each clip will last maximum 30 days. Again, based on my past experience with these clips, I found this claim similar to “Up to 70% OFF” signs on shopping malls. You would be lucky if you get full 30 days. To my surprise, I got one clip half-filled while all others 70% filled – see attached picture of half-filled clip right out of box.",4.0

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,DOWNY 40 L AF,CA,Wonderfully soft clothes!,"I used this for one laundry load, while using another leading brand''''s fabric softener in another load. This is clearly not my first rodeo with Downy, but we wanted to see for sure if there was a difference. Our clothes that ran with Downy were, surprisingly, not only soft but ended up smelling amazing, even after a week of being in the closet. The other load smelled good too, but didn''''t last as long. As far as fabric softening, both fared well, but Downy''''s is the best by far. We thoroughly enjoy how our clothes looked *almost* new (I did throw in a lot of old shirts, so Downy couldn''''t perform miracles). The downside for me (and reason for losing a star) is that when I went to check Downy''''s prices at several mass merchandisers, they are very overpriced. Considering fabric softening can also occur with dryer sheets, I''''m not sure it has a selling point there anymore, so the price cannot be thoroughly justified. Overall, I would recommend the product, if you''''re really looking for a true fabric softener. But price wise, either stick with dryer sheets or wait for a sale.

Fabric Care,Bounce,Fabric Enhancer,BOUNCE 80 S ODF,CA,Static Clean Won''t Survive Bounce Dryer Sheets,"Classic Bounce Outdoor Fresh Scent Dryer Sheets are great for people who prefer dryer sheets over liquid fabric softener. They are also ideal for people who enjoy a long lasting scent on fresh washed clothes, bedding, etc. I used Classic Bounce as I normally would in the clothes dryer, I simply tossed in a sheet with my wet clothes and dried as usual. Bounce works super at controlling static cling, which is especially important in the drier winter months where static is more prevalent. I also used Classic Bounce sheets in gym shoes and sports bags to keep them fresh. As a pet owner, it''''s important to me to have a dryer sheet which helps to repel hair and fur. I find that there is little fur and hair on our clothes when I use Bounce dryer sheets over competitor brands. The lint trap really does it''''s job at collection. Classic Bounce outdoor fresh scent leaves clothes smelling fresh long after laundry day. While I like the scent, I find it to be a little on the strong perfumy side for me. I personally prefer a slightly softer scent. Classic Bounce does it''''s job well. I will continue to buy and use Classic Bounce Outdoor Fresh dryer sheets for my laundry and freshen up needs.

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,Swiffer WetJet Wood Hardwood Floor Spray Mop Starter Kit,CA,Cleans Wonderfully,"I was quite impressed by the improvements compared to other Swiffer products. This is sturdy and well made. The refill was easy to install and remove at the touch of a button. The pad attaches almost magnetically and there’s no need to poke the corners into slots like other Swiffers. My hardwood floors are horrible especially on the frequently travelled areas. Despite this I think it did a pretty good job of making the floor look a little better. I like that it leaves a light wax finish which will protect in between washes. The spray hits about a foot in front so don’t start close to the wall. Drying time was certainly faster than if I’d used a mop and bucket. Obviously refills are more expensive than if you were just using a mop and bucket, but that’s the price you pay for convenience. There’s quite a large selection of cleaning solutions to choose from so there’s probably something in there to suit everyone. When not in use it can be hung up beside your brooms, etc. I honestly can’t find a fault with this product and will definitely continue to use it.",5.0

Tide has always been very effective and, as I mentioned in another review about a stain remover product, I find that I very rarely even need a separate stain remover as there is little, if anything, that Tide can't get out itself: Some stains may require a longer wash time or to not be washed with too large a load of other items, perhaps particularly in a front load machine, OR use a bit of Tide directly ON the stain, as per the instructions.",5.0

Home Care,Cascade,Auto Dishwashing,"Cascade Actionpacs Dishwasher Detergent, Fresh Scent, 25 Count",CA,Works very well but too strong a scent for me,"We have a good testing ground for dishwasher detergent. Each load consists of greasy, dirty and stuck on food. We found the dishes came out very clean. There was water left on the tops of some of the dishes but that happens with other detergents we have tried as well. I did find the scent very strong as I could smell it as soon as I walked into my door with the dishwasher running. We do not use a lot of artificial scents so we might notice them more than other people. Though the pouch is resealable, I had problems tearing the pouch open so it tore below the reseal zipper. Pros: - removes greasy residue for sparkling dishes (uses Dawn brand soap) - ShineShield acts as rinse aid & rinses away residues and leaves a very nice shine - ActionPacs makes it easy to use the correct amount each wash - resealable pouch Cons: - strong artificial smell - some difficulty tearing open pack Design / Functionality - 8/10 Quality / Construction - 6/10 Value - 7/10 (Price at time of review - $7.88) Please see photos below for more information.

But that being said, to me, this cleans just as well as any of the Tide pods I used in the past... perfectly well. Though I have always pretreated stains immediately using Tide-to-Go so don't often have stained clothing. I had some initial reservations about the Febreeze co-branded pods and actually put our pets in room far away from the washing machine & turned on air purifiers just in case... that stuff isn't going for small animals. I found my fear to be largely unfounded though. The scent lingers in the clothing a little but I didn't find it to be overly powerful in the air after doing laundry. I don't really care much for this scent over whatever ""normal"" scent the other Tide pods had... it's all the same to me. Everything smells fresh.",5.0

The laundry room reeks with the fragrance from an unopened box. Unusable as my spouse is extremely sensitive to perfumes. Why would any company do this? It's false advertising and false marketing.

With a 6 year old and a 2 year old running around the house, these things are out often and being used....a lot. With 2 young kids, crayons have become my nemesis. I find them every where throughout our house. And with them, I find the little pictures they have left behind. Sometimes on paper, sometimes on our tile floor. Thankfully, these Magic Erasers make short work of my ""Little Artist's"" handy work and cleaning up after them with these is simple and effortless.

(Like a lot of people , I'm scent sensitive) 4. I think it's price is on the high side.( but I'm not taking off a star for that) Recommend this laundry detergent for the above reasons.",5.0
Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,Tide Simply Clean & Fresh Refreshing Breeze High Efficiency Liquid Laundry Detergent,CA,A little strong on scent.,"Perhaps it's because I've toned down my household cleaning products to more natural sources , along with strong scents that make my husband and me itch and give me headaches. I bought this to only use a little for my husbands strong smelly summer clothes. And I only have to add a very small amount to my detergent without smell, but it is still fairly strong. A little goes a long way as far as smell.",4.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer 360 dusters heavy duty pet starter kit, extendable handle with 3 count duster refills , 1 Count",CA,Works great and makes dusting fast and easy and actually picks up dirt in high and hard to reach areas,"This duster works very effectively in removing dust. I am very happy with this duster because as opposed to the traditional duster where you sweep off dust from one area onto another surface this actually locks the dust preventing it from flying away. This product it more hygienic and effective in removing dust for good compared to any other method. I really like this product because its great for hard to reach and small places and works good for lights, fans and blinds so the dust doesn't fall onto the floor on your table and it captures it. Each pad lasts a long time and I like how I can visually see how much dirt it picks up which you normally wouldn't notice. This is light weight, easy to use and easy to maneuver around small tight places. I like how its long making it very convenient to access high and hard to reach areas. I absolutely recommend this product and think its worth the price as its makes cleaning and dusting easy and fast because it picks up dirt instead of just moving it around.",5.0

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,TIDE LQ PODS WFF BR 4/23 CT  E,CA,"Easy, convenient, and all-in-one solution to make laundry easy!","I've been using these Tide PODS since they first came out. The original motivation was because of the ease of use: no more powders or liquids to mess around with: just grab a POD and throw it in the washer. Since their introduction, Tide has continually improved the product, going to 3-in-1 and 4-in-1 features, including adding fabric softener like Febreze to the solution. These PODs dissolve completely in the laundry, with no residue left usually (every now and again, I'll find a ""skin"" from the POD, but it's rare). Every time the PODS do a superb job of cleaning my clothes, including making them softer. PODs come in a variety of mixes and fragrances, so experiment to find the one you like best. I tend to buy whatever is on sale, as none of the fragrances are objectionable, although there is a fragrance and dye free POD available for those who want it. Overall, I've been using these PODs for years and can't imagine switching to anything else. A convenient and easy way to get the laundry going!",5.0

I loaded the washer and added the downy fabric softener, first time I have used downy in our washer machine and it was very easy. I just added the downy to a separate compartment and pressed the fabric softener button. The clothes took the same amount time but I could tell right away when I removed clothes from the dryer that they were a different texture. My normally staticky and heavy feeling clothes had a softness and lightness to them. Just folding the clothes I could tell they felt soft. After days in the closet the clothes continued to have a soft feeling to them. A difference that was noticeable to not only me but the whole family. The extra downy step was worth it.

For me, although I find the product is good, it's not so much better than just using regular Tide and Downy that I will be using these after this packet runs out. I understand Tide needed the complicated bag locking mechanism to keep children out but it's the equivalent of wrestling with the childlock on the Tylenol when one has a splitting headache. Ain't got no time for that! I don't have children so I'd be inclined to transfer these to a small container for ease of use. It IS nice to not have to clean up the blue drip/spill that inevitably happens from liquid detergent. And it may be good for people who can't lift heavy bottles of detergent and value ease of use above all. Again, you're paying for the convenience. I was shocked to suggest they recommend using up to three of these pods for a larger load. That doesn't make sense. I only used one per load no matter its size and it was just fine. It's the detergent marketing equivalent of ""shampoo, rinse, repeat""! ...trying to get you to use more. The pods are pretty, though!

On the third use the trigger mechanism broke... the mechanism is a plastic piece with very small plastic nubs to keep it in place and both of them snapped off. Once this happens it is completely useless because you can no longer have it steam. On top of it breaking, it was mostly useless in the first place. After sweeping I would use the steamer and it would just leave streaks all over our hardwood floors.

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer Duster 360 Starter Kit, 2 Count",CA,Buy Refills.

(granted I had not dusted on top of door and window frames in over a year) Consumable - Throw-away dusters clog up landfills. Cost: Refills are pricey, this kit only comes with 3 which was enough to do my house ONCE. Dog Hair doesn't stick well to it, and also reduces its performance. Instructions don't show HOW to attach duster to refills. Theres hard to locate little ""sleeves"" in center of the duster that are hidden behind fluff. Performance: 5 stars. Loses a star for wasteful disposable parts and difficulty of installing new dusters. Another Star for operating costs (refills add up!)",3.0

With dogs in the house, fur or hair isn't the most common problem we face, but paw prints from trips outside picking up dirt and mud. Of course, besides these pads you also need bottles of spray solution, but the two together are an effective cleaning system. I've used many different types of wet mops in the past, from traditional ones to several squirt-and-wipe models from other manufacturers, and keep coming back to Swiffer because they are the easiest to work with. These are a must-have in my cleaning arsenal, so having a steady supply of refills is important. I have yet to be disappointed in the Swiffer WetJet,",5.0

I have been washing my clothes with a regular HE detergent for the last three years and the clothes still smell horrendous despite me washing them several times every time I do laundry... I have three long sleeved shirts in particular that smelled VERY horrible no matter how many frequent times I have washed them and increased the detergent dosage. I ordered this product as a last resort yesterday after I googled for powerful detergents for smelly clothes and I saw this brand among them and thought it would be the easiest to get so I searched it on amazon and ordered it.. I was skeptical yet desperate... so it arrived this afternoon and I immediately tested it on those three shirts... BYE BYE SMELL.. they all smell fresh and the detergent scent is not strong...strong enough to cleanse and give a good fresh scent but not enough to be allergic to or give you a bad headach or whatever.. great product,5.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer Sweeper Dry Sweeping Cloths Mop and Broom Unscented Floor Cleaner, 48 Count",CA,Cheap starter kit. Light weight. Can be disassembled and reassembled. Works just as advertised.,"I use a Bissell wet vacuum cleaner to clean my wooden floors in my apartment. But, sometimes the floors are not dirty enough to warrant that extreme level of cleaning. That is when this Swiffer sweeper kit comes in very handy. I have used the kit 3-4 times now, and here are my impressions. - The starter kit is very affordable ($15 as I am writing this review). So, the starter kit is not a huge investment. However, the replacement costs of the dry cloth (Amazon sells a 48-pack for $14.99) and wet pads (24-pack for $9.97) will cost more. So, you have to look at those costs to decide if this starter kit is right for you. - It is very easy to assemble and disassemble. It is small enough to fit in a carry on luggage. So, it is very portable. Also, it helps that it is extremely lightweight. - The starter kit came with 7 dry cloths and 3 wet ones. I swept my floors first with the dry cloth. Then, I cleaned the floors with the wet pad. The wet pad lasted for the entire living room, kitchen, and dining area. It was almost dry by the end of it, but it was pretty impressive that one wet pad was enough for that huge area. - Having said that, the wet pad does not do as good a job as a proper mopping. It is good for a quick wet cleaning of the surfaces, but I would still use my Bissell wet vacuum once a week to get a more thorough cleaning. But, the wet pad clearly does a good job for which it was designed. That's great.",5.0

Overpriced, not good if you like to let your clothes soak in traditional washer.","These work really well as a detergent, but you will still need fabric softener. Save your money and just get separate fabric softener I used these in a traditional washer (not HE) which it says its compatible with. I think that the different ""pockets"" of stuff are supposed to break at different times (softener being last) however the end result was that if we don't use fabric softener with this, we're left with crunchy towels and our clothes don't feel nearly as soft. Also, sometimes for stubborn stains or particularly soiled clothes we like to put detergent in and let it sit - If you do that with these, they'll settle to the bottom and then after a while they'll ""leak"" so you have to make sure to agitate the washer after a while to make sure the soap distributes and actually cleans your clothes. Overall, I'm not super impressed, particularly for the price. I'd personally go with something more value oriented as these don't seem to do any better a job, and you STILL have to get softener, negating the value-add. 2/5 stars.

While white tea is an unusual fragrance to have in an detergent, the combination of the white tea and lavender is very pleasant. The scent isn't over powering and you do lose some of it after a wash and dry, but not enough that it's unnoticeable. I actually prefer the light scent that it leaves, even when I use a little less than suggested on my clothes. I do have sensitive skin, and this detergent has been fine for me.

Home Care,Cascade,Auto Dishwashing,"Cascade Platinum ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent, Lemon Scent, 16 count",CA,Washes any dishes clean,"For the past few days, we have been cooking some very messy foods, like Sheppard's pie, which always leaves its dish with a nice crust all around its dish, which usually takes a few scrubs to clean it out by hand before it goes in the dishwasher. We've also had some chocolate fondue for dessert, which leaves its dish with hard chocolate that takes a lot of hot water to clean, and much more hard to wash dishes, like dry eggs on a plate, lasagna, and other dirty pots and pans. And, at first, we tried it the usual way, which is to clean the dishes by hand first, then put it in the dishwasher, and always, everything turned out spotless, and I also noticed there were no water spots on the glasses and silverware. Then we tried it without pre-washing it by hand, so we put in our Sheppard's pie dish, which had stuck-on food for more than 24 hours, and pans with burned food residues, and in the end, the results were very good, the stuck-on food was completely gone, as well as the burned food residues, and the silverware were still spotless and sparkling clean. As for the dishwasher, it was nice and clean, no food residues left on the walls of the machine or at the bottom, and I think it's a good thing to mention that we are using a recent Bosch dishwasher, which is one of the best brands of dishwashers, so it surely must help in keeping it clean, because even without Cascade Platinum our dishwasher was always clean after a load of dishes. Overall, I think we'll keep washing our dishes by hand and using a lower-grade dishwasher detergent, just to save a few bucks, but surely during holidays and birthdays it would be great to buy these Cascade Platinum to save a little time and make the task a little easier to be able to relax a little more and enjoy more time with friends and family.",5.0

Fabric Care,Bounce,Fabric Enhancer,BOUNCE 80 S ODF,CA,Good if you need the convenience,"These Bounce fabric softener sheets are not really my first choice but if my circumstances were different, they would be. I prefer liquid fabric softener, but my washing machine makes using liquid convenient. If I had to use a laundromat or add liquid softener part way through a cycle I would definitely use these sheets. The first thing I noticed was the scent. It''''s pleasant and not overpowering. I''''m sensitive to smells and these didn''''t bother me. Even the scent outside from the dryer exhaust was quite nice. The product is as convenient as it can be. You simply pull out one sheet and toss it in the dryer. Done. As for the claims made on the packaging, that was disappointing. I suppose I should not have expected a dryer sheet to get rid of wrinkles. That''''s a task these are simply not up to. They also don''''t control static as much as I would have liked. I''''m using them in early December as the weather is turning cold. The air gets very dry and static becomes a problem. These sheets were just not able to control static like my usual product. They did leave the laundry smelling nice and much softer than using no softener at all. Overall these are not my first choice for fabric softener but they are definitely not terrible.

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,DOWNY 40 L AF,CA,Truly Enhances,"Downy April Fresh Liquid Fabric Enhancer truly enhances my laundry! It is definitely more than just a fabric softener, it is a product that delivers a great protective quality along with a great, long-lasting fresh smell. Pros: long-lasting scent (even after sitting in my dresser for a week), helps reduce wrinkles in my work shirts, less fuzz and pills on my sweatshirts, soft towels and keeps the colors on my children''''s clothing bright. Definitely a useful product for myself and my kids. Cons: This product claims to help prevent static cling. However, in my experience I still had some static cling while using it, especially with towels. I had to throw the towels back into the dryer with a fabric softener sheet. This however is not a deal breaker and I still recommend this product 100%. Other than the prevention of static cling Downy April Fresh Liquid Fabric Enhancer delivers on all it''''s promises. It''''s easy to pour and is not a huge extra step for all the benefits it supplies.

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer Duster 360 Starter Kit, 2 Count",CA,Double the Dusting Power !,"We love the versatility of the Swiffer duster with the added 360. After using the regular Swiffer for years around the house we found this 360 Swiffer really added dusting power. The starter kit includes 1 handle and 2 unscented disposable dusters. We have a house full of animals, teenagers and constant renovations so we have a great testing ground. The 360-feature added to the amount of dust, animal fur and debris that could be picked up in a shorter amount of time and more thorough. The functionality & low price equates to high value. It is great to have the options of no added scent and money back guarantee. Refills are $5.49 for three on Amazon at the time of review. Pros: - 50% more fibers than regular Swiffer Dusters - money back guarantee - fibers trap dust to clean the smallest areas - great versatility from the car to small electronics - no noxious chemical smell Cons: - refills must be disposed of after they become dirty - purchase of refills is required Design / Functionality - 10/10 Quality / Construction - 9/10 Value - 10/10 (Price at time of review - $5.97) Please see photos below for more information.

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,Swiffer Wetjet Floor Mop Starter Kit,CA,Does what it does quite well.,"This is a great alternative to a mop and bucket, especially for the fake hardwood floors that you can't get too wet. PROS • Includes batteries • Included several Swiffer sheets to use. • Good distance on the spray. • Effective at cleaning and picking up dust and fur off the floor. CONS • Handle is a little too short. I'm pretty short and found myself bending forward quite a bit. • Handle construction could be a little more sturdy. You can feel the wobble in the connection points. I would definitely recommend to someone who can't use a mop and bucket on their fake flooring.",4.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer Sweeper Floor Mop Starter Kit, 1 Count",CA,Convenient System and Mops Well Enough; Dry Cloths Not Useful on Most Floors,"SUMMARY For $15, you can't go wrong. If this were priced, say, $50, I would probably only give it 3 stars. But for the money, it really delivers. UNBOXING AND SETUP Most people are at least passingly familiar with how Swiffer works, but I'll just touch on the basics. The Swiffer 'mop' stick is as easy to assemble as tent pegs - just slide the pieces together in any order. The pads are also a breeze to attach, by tucking in the four corners into the serrated slots on top of the unit head. INCLUDED IN BOX This set includes 7 dry cloths. Personally I find these useless for anything other than dusting. If you have any dirt or crumbs, it just pushes them around your floor. So I actually don't use these on the Swiffer itself - I use these as separate dusting cloths on my TV, bookshelves, knicknaks, etc. Otherwise, you might as well save your energy and just vacuum the area. WET CLOTHS FOR MOPPING The wet cloths, however, is where the utility of this set kicks in. You receive only a starter pack containing 3 wet cloths, so when you divide it by the purchase price each wet cloth is somewhat expensive. However, the refills come in a pack of 24 for about $10 so with tax it's less than 50 cents per mopping cloth. (Here they are: Swiffer Sweeper Wet Mopping Pad Multi Surface Refills for Floor Mop, Open Window Fresh scent, 24 Count ) Does the mopping feature work? Yes. It's much better than hauling out a mop and bucket, and diluting cleaner into it. Each wet cloth covers only a small area of approximately 250 square feet before it started to get blotchy. So if you have a larger area to clean, you may need more than one cloth. It left a pleasant scent which lingered for about an hour or so after 'mopping' the floor. One feature that confused me at first was the green rough edge of the wet cloth which you're meant to use to scrub away harder, crustier spots on your floor. Because the Swiffer unit head articulates so well, I couldn't get the leverage needed to actually scrub anything. Then I actually read the package and it instructs you to turn the unit head over to scrub. (**Please see my attached video: This is hard to explain so I enlisted the help of a willing bystander to show how it's done.**) Once I figured this out, it actually became more useful as a practical cleaning tool for kitchen floors. I like how the wet cloth package re-seals to keep things moist and tucked away inside. They're somewhat messy to handle but because it's cleaning fluid, it's not going to make anything worse (although I washed my hands right away). This system probably isn't the best for the landfill, overall. The package says the wet cloths contain no phosphates. CONCLUSION Overall, as far as convenience goes, using the wet cloth over a traditional mop-and-bucket is far less cumbersome. It's a bit pricey to begin with, but costs per wet cloth fall when you buy them in larger quantity. As stated above, the dry cloths are useless on the floor unless you're only dealing with light cosmetic dust and not any real crumbs. It works well to trap hair. I will probably buy another set of wet cloths after I've used the included 3.",4.0

It's easily extensible, it's bendable and locks into whichever position you choose. I really appreciate that it can be used with either the 360 or 180 cloths because I tend to buy whichever is on sale, once you have this handle, there's no need to buy this set again since it's robust enough to last for years, all you'll need are the refills.

Fabric Care,Tide,LAUNDRY,"Tide PODS Laundry Detergent, Original, 72 Count",CA,"Cheaper than local, works as good as anything else","Not that putting laundry detergent, stain remover and fabric softener in the washer is time consuming, and not that the amount is confusing, but these save a lot of time and effort. Is it dirty? Put one in. Is it REALLY dirty? Put two in. I work in very dirty environments. Exceptionally dirty environments. I work in areas where there can be a layer of petroleum coke dust, or petcoke, and just one of these pods will clean my clothing back to wearable condition. That is an impressive feat. These are great just for making things easy. They can tackle most things that are thrown at it. Our town, Fort McMurray, was evacuated in May after a wildfire nearly wiped it out. When we returned, I took time off from my primary trade as an electrician to do landscaping and beautification around the affected parts of town and our clothes were covered in grass, mud, ash, dirt, grass stains etc. We used two of these pods per load to clean our work clothing and you'd never know we wore them for landscaping. But I digress, you could easily buy these things separately, but if you find the coupons on amazon and are a subscribe and save member, these are cheap and easy and can save you a few minutes every load. Set it and forget it. The cost of these with the coupon and the subscribe and save discount was over $5 cheaper than my local walmart.",5.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,Swiffer Dusters Kit with Handle and 5 Unscented Refills- Packaging May Vary,CA,Traps and removes dust build up - doesn't just brush it into the air or onto the floor,"I used my first Swiffer duster about 2 years ago and couldn’t believe I hadn’t tried them sooner! These handheld dusters are awesome for sweeping over all the surfaces in your home and removing the dust build up. Instead of just wiping at the dust and brushing it off onto the floor to be vacuumed up or swirl around in the air to settle somewhere else, these dusters swipe through the dirt and trap it in the fibers. My old duster that I have admittedly been using a bit too long, hasn’t been picking up dust like it used to and now that I have these fresh dusters, I can immediately notice the difference. Depending on how often you dust and how dusty your house gets, one duster can last about a month or two. During the summer when I have the windows and patio door open, it can get a lot dustier inside so I have to replace them sooner. The Swiffer duster is about 13 inches long once you attach the two halves together. This gives you a fair amount of reach for harder to reach areas and it has a loop on the end so you can hang it up when it’s not in use. The duster itself is blue and white and about 4.5 inches by 7.5 inches so it has a pretty good surface area to wipe down large areas but the pliability of the duster allows it to fit into small nooks easily. When the blue and white fibers start to look dark grey and stops trapping dust - it's time to replace it!",5.0

I have a spray bottle of my preference, PineSol lightly diluted, and after a few quick sprays the dry Swiffer sweeper gets everything clean and is far more efficient vs pushing a dirty mop around the floor!

Not too powerful, but fantastic. I hadn''''t used a fabric softener in my HE machine before, so I read the directions and poured it in the separate dispenser. While the machine was going, the smell was amazing, even right outside of the laundry room. When it was time for the dryer, I wondered whether or not to include a dryer sheet. I didn''''t know if this made it not necessary, or if they were meant to be used together? So, I skipped the dryer sheet, not knowing what I would get. Static drives me crazy.

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,Swiffer WetJet Wood Hardwood Floor Spray Mop Starter Kit,CA,"Easy to use - good spray amount, batteries included! I'm mopping more often!","The Swiffer Wet Jet kit works well on all my floor surfaces, including hardwood floor. I have 2 small dogs and sometimes they track in a bit of dirt. It is so much easier just to take out the Swiffer Wet Jet and quickly mop the floor after vacuuming which offers floor cleaner (safe for pets too) and a mop in one. Before I had the Swiffer Wet Jet, unless of a spill, I rarely mopped my floor because i had to fill a bucket with water, get out the mop and then after, wash the mop in the washing machine and hang to dry. The Swiffer Wet Jet makes it so easy to mop so I will incorporate mopping into my weekly cleaning routine, instead of just for the deep clean days. You get a decent amount of solution sprayed when you hold down the button and it makes it easy to clean with, and not having a tonne of excess water you are pushing around. The mop pad did a great job picking up dirt and keeping it there, not just pushing it around. At the end of my clean, it was easy to remove the pad and toss it away. I did notice that occasionally I pushed the spray button when I was just mopping back and forth and didn’t actually need any more water. I think I hold the mop a bit too far down, but if you hold it properly on the handle, the button is easy to reach and not in the way. I wish that you could refill the bottle with your own cleaning solution but of course Swiffer wants you to buy the Swiffer refill bottles so I understand why it is not a refillable bottle. I am appreciative that it came with 4 AA batteries included. This is always a plus!",4.0

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,DWY UNSTPBLS SPRING 6/19.5Z,CA,One of my favourite products ever!,"I have tried quite a few different scents and brands of scent boosters and this one is my absolute favourite! It smells so amazing and the scent lasts for a really long time on your clothes. My family gets compliments all the time, even from strangers standing in line near us, saying how good we smell. I only use about a quarter to a third of a capful for an extra large load of laundry, so you don't need much of it to do the job. And it works great in cold water too but only on a regular cycle, if you use it in a quick wash cycle with cold water the beads don't dissolve properly so you'll be picking them off your clothes. But since the scent is so strong I would not recommend using it with your sheets because it's way too strong of a scent to be breathing in when you sleep, at least I find it is anyway. But it's perfect for everything else, especially if you have really dirty or stinky clothes. Love love love this product! It's one of the best products I've ever found and I use it all the time.

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,TIDE 24 HE FREE,CA,New Innovation without Compromise,"When I was a child observing my mom do the laundry, Tide was almost always her laundry detergent of choice. I remember once asking her why she always used this brand when there are so many other ones to choose from, like the alternatives advertised on TV? She simply replied ""because it''''s the best one."" Now, as an adult who does his own laundry, I follow in my mom''''s footsteps and also use Tide. It is well known by many that Tide is a trusted brand of laundry detergent that you can count on in getting the job done. Tide HE Turbo Clean Free and Gentle Liquid Laundry Detergent is a great new and welcomed Tide variety, with a tested formula suitable for those with sensitivities to fragrances or heavy scents. The most notable new feature of Tide HE Turbo Clean Free and Gentle Liquid Laundry Detergent is the lack of over-sudsing. Unlike some other laundry detergents, this means no more turning your washing machine into a foamy bubble bath! The benefits gained from Tide''''s innovation does not compromise the trusted stain fighting power and quality that we''''ve come to expect from Tide.

Home Care,Cascade,Auto Dishwashing,"Cascade Platinum ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent, Lemon Scent, 16 count",CA,Excellent performance .

Quite frankly I was not expecting these to match the cleaning performance of the Finish quantum. I rarely pre rinse dishes before racking them in the dishwasher. I leave stuff caked on. I have washed dishes 5 times with these cascade platinum pucks now. I have to say I don't notice a difference , which means that I am very impressed. Cutlery comes out just as clean. Dishes and Tupperware and glasses are excellent sparkling clean. You must use rinse agent. Too many people forget to refill this. What then? Should I switch? Well cascade platinums are significantly cheaper per puck, than finish quantum pucks. And they wash my disgusting dishes just as well. So the answer is YES. Glad to have tried this product",5.0

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,"Tide Pods + Febreze Sport Odor Defense Laundry Pacs, Active Fresh Scent, Regular & He Washers, 15 Count",CA,"Cleans well, very strongly scented","In my experience, Tide consistently provides the best results (compared to other brands) when it comes to laundering heavily soiled clothes, linens, etc. I have always trusted it to 'get the job done' when it comes to things like my husband's work clothes or the dog's blanket, so trying this was a no brainer for me. I have never used laundry 'pods' before, so I was also curious to see what the fuss was about. As far as performance goes, I did not notice any difference between the pods and my liquid Tide detergent. I used one pod for what I would consider an average (medium sized) load, and my clothes came out clean. I feel I must point out that I was washing 'regular' laundry- not anything too heavily soiled or smelly. It wasn't unexpected, given that these pods have '+ Febreze Sport Odor Defense' and are clearly geared for stinky, sweat saturated, clothes, but I did find my clothes were quite heavily scented- definitely more so than usual. If strong perfumes aren't your thing then you will probably want to avoid these all together. However, when it comes to say...sports uniforms, workout clothes or just musty or heavily soiled items, I think these would definitely be the way to go for fresher smelling laundry...... The bottom line for me: these provide the dependable results I have come to expect from Tide, however, the stronger scent (which I don't really care for, if I am being honest) is unnecessary, and in my case unwanted, for my usual laundering needs , so I will be reserving these for heavy duty laundering only. As for the pods vs. regular liquid detergent? I will stick with my liquid Tide. There is nothing wrong with the pods, don't get me wrong, but I see absolutely no advantage to using them either. I am perfectly capable/content to measure exactly as much, or as little, detergent as I want to use. It's not a big deal.",4.0

There is also some dust that's stubborn and stuck maybe because it's been there so long, in those instances you might need a wet rag to remove.

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,Swiffer Wetjet Floor Mop Starter Kit,CA,Very convenient for light jobs.,"I've been thinking of getting a Swiffer, so it was nice to receive this one. It's fairly easy to set up, although it wasn't clear how to attach the cleaning cloth, apparently it just sits there. It comes with 4 batteries to power the sprayer in front. I don't know how it works, you just stick the bottle of cleaning fluid in and press it down, you don't have to open it. The only thing I didn't like about the spray pump was the location of the switch, on top of the handle. Lots of times when pushing the device forward, I would inadvertently push the spray switch. They should have put a trigger underneath or something. It cleans well, I chose a floor that is only swept, and hasn't been mopped in years. It is some kind of linoleum, and the Swiffer did a good job of cleaning it, however, once the cleaning pad became very dirty, it just pushed the dirt around since there was no where else for it to go. I wiped over the floor with a paper towel and picked up tons of dirt the Swiffer couldn't get because it was full. To do a big job you would need to remove the pad and rinse it or something. For light duty I guess it would be OK. You only need to push it around and hit the spray button, very convenient.",5.0
Fabric Care,Gain,Laundry,"Gain Botanicals Plant Based Laundry Detergent, Orange Blossom Vanilla, 48 Loads 2.21 Liter",CA,You Need to Use More But it Works,"This works better than I'd expected given I'm not your 'typical' eco-friendly purchaser when it comes to cleaning products. This Gain Botanicals isn't *all* natural, however; it's apparently comprised of 65% natural ingredients. The smell is extremely pleasant - orange and vanilla. The smell doesn't last, unfortunately, when your clothes are dry. This may be a plus for those who don't love a lingering scent. Drawbacks for me are twofold: you need to use a lot more of this liquid (about 20% more) than a 'regular' liquid detergent - so is this really environmentally friendly given you will be buying it more frequently (plastic bottles, transport effects, etc.)? The liquid itself is a lot runnier and thinner than the typical detergent so 'overpouring' is easier. Another drawback (this may be a small point for some) is the bottle handle itself is painful to use - at least the one I got. It's not nice when the seam of the plastic is so rough it almost feels like it's cutting your hand when you're holding the full liquid bottle. But maybe this is a bottle production issue that is a one-off for me - you may not experience it. But it's not nice. On the whole, though, the product works as it claims and cleans your clothes just as well as more 'traditional' liquid detergent. I don't have heavily-stained clothes, however, so keep that in mind if you have grease- and grass-stained clothing. I can't attest to its efficacy. But I do recommend it for everyday cleaning.",4.0

I personally notice that it leaves a bit too much lemon scent to the dishes after washing, so it needs an extra rinse, which I'm not a big fan of. Although the pods are convenient, I still prefer the cheaper box of loose powder so that less or more detergent can be added. On top of that, I find the powder easier to store than pods.

Fabric Care,Tide,Laundry,"Tide Pods + Febreze Sport Odor Defense Laundry Pacs, Active Fresh Scent, Regular & He Washers, 15 Count",CA,"Great pods, but I want more!","Let me tell you, I love tide laundry detergent. I have tried many, including well renowned Costco Nellie's big bucket of Laundry, however nothing compared to Tide, for me at least. The pods are very convinient, just throw in a pod or 2 depending on your load size and be done with it. -works for all temperatures -works with top load or front load, both standard and high efficiency -4 in one Detergent + stain remover + color protector + odor defense The scent on this product is strong. I don't know if everyone will like the after wash scent lingering on your clothes. This tide pods claims to be formulated with HE Turbo technology for 6X the cleaning power in half the time. Although it did a good job, I was hoping it can remove the oil residue on my bed sheet. As seen in the picture, unfortunately it leaves more to be desired, does not clean it thoroughly.. May be I will have to soak it in vinegar + baking soda to get rid of the stain or wash it few more times.. It would have been fantastic if this was able to remove the oil stains..",4.0

Most of the time I reach for one of these dusters because they are easier to use and they really do keep dust locked away in their little fibres. I've been using one version or another of these dusters for years, and I am very happy with their performance. The duster has very soft fibres and is perfectly safe to use on TV screens and computer monitors. I've never had a duster stratch anything. They are also great at getting into tight spots and cleaning bumping and irregular surfaces (like knick-knacks and Lego). This particular package includes one handle and 5 dusters. Depending on how dusty your home is, one duster can last quite a long while before needing to be changed.",5.0

It boasts being eco friendly and made in a no waste environment its designed free of dyes, chlorine, phosphates for people that want a more natural product. This is more expensive then the regular tide which is kind of a bummer due to the overall cost it might put some people off who would or want to try to help the environment but the sheer amount of laundry some households do it is not cost effective.

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,DOWNY 40 L AF,CA,Nothing compares to Downey!,"Downy has always been the fabric softener we use in our household. The classic April Fresh scent is my absolute favorite. My clothes are so soft and smell amazing even weeks after I’ve washed them using Downy. Compared to other similar products this one is always no.1 on my list. The quality is also top notch! The consistency is not watered down and is safe for my High Effeciency (HE) washer. I’ve used other brands previously that have clogged my softener dispenser... I’ve never had to worry about this using Downy! In addition, I don’t like to iron and notice a dramatic difference in wrinkle reduction from when I do use Downy to when I do not. In my opinion nothing is more satisfying than when you pull a freshly washed towel from the dryer and breathe in that amazing fresh scent you only get with Downy. I also love that even weeks after towels, sheets or clothes have been washed they still keep that satisfying aromatic bliss you only get with Downy fabric softener. Being a dog owner this is a big deal to me since doggies tend to be stinky. When I use Downy I never have to worry about having that doggie funk on me. This is another big bonus for me! I recommend this product over any other competitor out there! I also love when someone asks me what perfume I’m wearing and I get to tell them it’s not a perfume it’s my fabric softener! #bliss #downeyfresh #smellssogood [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer Wetjet Original Pad Refills, 24 Count Pack (Pack of 2)",CA,Love the Swiffer!,"In our house we have hardwood, vinyl plank and ceramic tile flooring and have used the standard Swiffer WetJet Multi-Surface pads for all surfaces with excellent results. The biggest difference between the regular Swiffer Wet Jet Pads and the WetJet Hardwood Floor Pads is the center strip which absorbs more of the cleaning fluid allowing the hardwood floor to dry out quickly. With the standard swiffer pads the floor stays wet for a a much longer period of time before the solution evaporates. With the Hardwood Wetjet pads the floor is dries much quicker than the standard pads yet it still seems to clean as effectively. Overall I like the faster absorbing Hardwood Swiffer WetJet pad for cleaning hardwood but we will probably continue to use the standard Swiffer WetJet pads in our house because we have three (3) different types of flooring and not just hardwood. If you're home is only hardwood then I would recommend using the Swiffer Hardwood pads, they're almost the same price as the standard pads and do a better job on hardwood. If you're home has mixed flooring like ours, you'll probably find the standard multi-surface swiffer pads more convenience because you won't have to keep switching pads on your mop and will only have to keep one type of pad in your closet.",5.0

Home Care,Cascade,Auto Dishwashing,"Cascade Actionpacs Dishwasher Detergent, Fresh Scent, 25 Count",CA,I'm a fan of the fresh scent,"Not only will these dishwasher packs clean your dishes and make your glassware sparkle, but they will leave you with the lovely scent of lemons. I already use Cascade's platinum dishwasher packs but they have an anticeptic, hospital smell, clean but not fresh. So for those of you who like a fresh scent as well as squeaky clean dishes you can now have it all. I also like the packs because it's just the right amount of cleaner going into the dishwasher and you don't have the messy container which may open and slop messy soap down the inside front of your dishwasher if you don't close the lid properly. I'm a fan and will keep buying these especially the lemon scent with dawn.",5.0

This one is exactly the same as the previous product, but the duster part feels much thicker. Compared to the previous one, this one can hold much more dust. The duster itself is pretty simple, you attach the plastic handle to a duster and then you fluff up the duster. After it's fluffed up, it's able to be used. The duster works very well and for the price, it's a really good deal. After I run out of refills for this one, I'm going to just buy the heavy duty one instead of the original as they're both the same price",5.0

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer Duster 360 Starter Kit, 2 Count",CA,A major improvement over earlier Swiffers,"The 360 is an improvement over Swiffer's old duster model. I used to buy the old for around $6.99 for a set of 3 on sale at my local grocery store in Calgary. Amazon's regular price of $5.97 for the brand new 360 undercuts competitors pretty steeply. As a bonus, I haven't had to leave my house for mundane household cleaning materials in years. An average dust filter will last one significant cleaning. I am in the top unit of a small house. I'd say I use them seriously once every few months, so they don't tend to cost more than $10 a year... and that's if I'm using them without supplementing with my hand vacuum. •• 360 Pros over previous models •• + Holds more dust + Cleans more efficiently due to increased surface area + The wand is adjustable in length, which allows you to get into deep nooks and crannies + The build quality on the wand is solid. I see it lasting a couple years of rough use. •• Cons •• - Still a disposable product, which is the reason for 4 stars. At the end of the day, you have to toss these out. I use my hand vacuum whenever possible, but these make certain jobs far easier (cleaning blinds, getting behind TV, etc). •• Conclusion •• These are abjectly better than earlier Swiffer models.

The pods go straight in with my clothing, it doesn't go in the dispenser with an HE machine. I noticed the amount of suds to be greater than the brand I usually use, but everything seemed to rinse out well. These clean well, I have washed my son's clothing with these after a camping trip and everything came clean. I was a little bit worried about the chocolate he had on his shirt from earlier in the weekend, I was unable to pre-treat it when it happened.

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,DOWNY 40 L AF,CA,Downy Delivers,"I think Downy is by far, the best fabric softener on the market. My laundry is comprised of work clothes, stinky sports uniforms, delicate items, and lots of towels and Downy leaves everything soft and smelling fresh (for those who have hockey enthusiasts in your house, you know a product is good if it can help get rid of the horrible hockey uniform smell). I love the fresh smell of Downy - it isn''''t too strong and it doesn''''t fight with a woman''''s perfume. In addition, the fresh smell remains even if an item sits in the closet unused for awhile. One of my teenage son''''s friends actually asked what we used to wash our clothes - just the fact that a teenage boy would ask is a product endorsement. As it relates to softness, Downy does an exceptional job. I have four children who think used towels should reside on the bathroom floor, so by the time the towels make it to the laundry room, they are mildewed or stiff as a board. Downy helps eliminate the smell of mildew and leaves the towels soft and fluffy. If only Downy could get my kids to hang their towels up . . . one can dream. One of my children suffers from eczema, so we have to be careful about detergents and softeners. Downy is the only softener we''''ve used that doesn''''t cause our son to erupt in an eczema outbreak. In our home, Downy delivers, so it has become a staple in the laundry room! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5.0

It seems to be fairly concentrated, so usually I only put in a little bit at a time. I had the teal ones before this and they seemed a little stronger.

Worst case, I would have to wash them again in my regular detergent. I was nicely surprised when taking the towels out of the washer. There was a pleasant scent of a flowery field, one that I liked. So to the next load - I found with the towels there were a lot of suds, so I reduced the amount I put in by just a bit and the load came out clean and fresh. The colors were vibrant which is a bonus compared to other detergents. I don’t know how earth friendly this detergent actually is. I do know my clothes feel a little nicer on me and it is definitely better than man-made chemicals going into our lakes and rivers. The end result is a great wash that is better for the environment. The issue I have with it is this. One scent for the wash detergent but there rarely seems to be the matching scent for the fabric softener be it dryer sheets or liquid. I hope they decide to make a fabric softener with the same scent soon.",5.0

This product is great for anyone looking for an alternative to liquid fabric softeners. Easy pull out sheets. Just toss them in the dryer. No fuss.

Fabric Care,Gain,Laundry,"Gain Botanicals Plant Based Laundry Detergent, Orange Blossom Vanilla, 48 Loads 2.21 Liter",CA,Nice... Except for the Scent,"I was excited to see that Gain Laundry Detergent has finally released a natural product that is made from 65% Plant-Based Ingredients, and is “bursting with botanical scent” of Orange Blossom Vanilla. Compatible with both high-efficiency and regular washing machines, this detergent promises “plant-based cleaning power”. As a certified bio-based product, it promises to be gentle enough for even sensitive skin and to be free of dyes, phosphates, brighteners, colorants, etc. As a family who tries to use primarily natural cleaners and detergents in our everyday lives, this product was a definite must-try. It did not irritate our family’s sensitive skin, and it cleaned even soiled laundry very well. It is not as concentrated as I had expected, however, and the directions call for a surprising large amount to be used for even a medium load. The biggest problem with this detergent, however, is the scent... Nobody in our family likes it, and unfortunately it lingers for a loooong time on the clothes. I understand that we are probably in the minority with this issue, because it likely isn’t a very strong scent compared to many regular detergents, but we are used to unscented products, or those scented with essential oils, and well, this fragrance is just overpowering and rather a deal-breaker for us. Unfortunately in the end, I don’t believe we will be purchasing this brand again, at least not until they come out with an unscented option!",2.0

When I've got the Pods I thought that if I put it into the full washer there is no chance it will be dispensed evenly. I was wrong. It did the job, and the laundry was clean as I used to it. There two important details that I don't like about the Pods. 1) It is more expensive than the powder. 2) I don't like the scent. Plus I find it too strong. Now about ""4 in 1"". The manufacturer explains it as: 1) detergent 2) stain remover 3) brightener 4) Downy Fabric Protect If to consider that one pod contains three cleaning products and fabric softener, so maybe it is not that expensive. If the laundry is heavy soiled and three pods have to be used - so the price per load is jumping up. I'm not going to remove any star just because the pods are hypothetically expensive.

Fabric Care,Downy,Fabric Enhancer,Downy® Infusions™ Lavender Serenity™ In-Wash Scent Booster Beads,CA,Downy Lavender Serenity Scent Booster,"Downy Infusions in- wash scent booster Lavender Serenity really kicked my laundry blues to lavender bliss. What a surprising experience! Love the scent of lavender and vanilla and the smell was not overpowering like some products can be. After drying my clothes could really smell the fresh, light fragrance, which lasted since the one item I put on was washed the week before and could smell the fragrance on the sweater. Great product for the entire family. As you add the beads before adding the clothes as the washer is filling, I had to remind myself as I usually put the load in first and then start filling with water. This product as a very pleasant surprise and I highly recommend Downy infusions Lavender Serenity.[This review was collected as part of a promotion]",5.0

I''''ve used it for 2 more loads that I put in the dryer since then and they are so soft, but no residue that you sometimes find using softners.

Home Care,Swiffer,Surface Care,"Swiffer Dusters 360 Extendable Handle Starter Kit, 4-Count",CA,Very flimsy and cheaply made but the dusters really grab dust well,"This item is very good at getting the dust from flat surfaces but only one side of the head is usable. The dust heads are coated with something that feels oily or waxy, but whatever it is is grabs the dust well. However you cannot shake it off outside - it stays there for good - and you are going to have to buy mop heads much more often. At least the dust won't fall off the head and go back into the air which is good. It is extremely flimsy - extremely. When the small hand held Swiffer duster first came out, I eventually bought one one a friend's recommendation It was much more robust than this one. I stopped using it because I had to keep buying the duster heads and it worked ok but not as well as a slightly dampened cloth. I then bought their dry dust mop a few years ago, more robustly made and it snapped withing months. I was looking for an extendable duster to attract and eliminate cobwebs and one that would fold over and clean the blades of my ceiling fan. I didn't want to get up on a stool because of fear of falling - I have osteoporosis. I still had to get up on a stool, I'm five foot two. When I swept it across I had to press down on it a little since the fan hadn't been cleaned in a while but the head just lifted up from the folding joint and looked about to snap. I then dusted the top of bookcases and it did get some dust and would be best if the dusting was done daily on these two surfaces. It worked well for cobwebs. Pros: -It grabs the dust very well with its waxy coating and is an improvement over previous Swiffer heads. - The dust doesn't fall off the head and travel back into the room - It bends over to clean ceiling fans and other flat, high surfaces - it really gets the cobwebs. Cons -The stick is very flimsy especially at the joint and looks like it won't last long. If it does, I will amend this review. - The mop heads will have to be changed after every dusting day. To sum up ,this item is very cheaply made. I was surprised that Swiffer - a respected company - would put their name on something as flimsy as this. It does grab the dust and I would advise the manufacturer to make these more robust. I'd pay a bit more to have the thing last longer. Finally, make the stick about six inches longer for shorter people to be able to use without climbing on a stool, which is the reason I bought it in the first place. Note: The replacement dust heads are $5.49 for three if you use Amazon as a seller. If you buy from outside sellers on Amazon they charge two to three times as much so be sure you are using Amazon as your seller.",3.0
